http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01578v2,"Gauss Sums, Stickelberger's Theorem, and the Gras Conjecture for Ray Class Groups","Let $k$ be a real abelian number field and $p$ an odd prime not dividing $[k:\mathbb{Q}]$. For a natural number $d$, let $E_d$ denote the group of units of $k$ congruent to $1$ modulo $d$, $C_d$ the subgroup of $d$-circular units of $E_d$, and $\mathfrak{C}(d)$ the ray class group of modulus $d$. Let $ρ$ be an irreducible character of $G=\mathrm{Gal}(k/\mathbb{Q})$ over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $e_ρ \in \mathbb{Z}_p[G]$ the corresponding idempotent. We show that if the ramification index of $p$ in $k$ is less than $p-1$, then $|e_ρ \mathrm{Syl}_p(E_d/C_d) | = |e_ρ \mathrm{Syl}_p(\mathfrak{C}_d)|$ where $\mathfrak{C}_d$ is the part of $\mathfrak{C}(d)$ where $G$ acts non-trivially. This is a ray class version of the Gras Conjecture. In the case when $p \mid [k:\mathbb{Q}]$, similar but slightly less precise results are obtained. In particular, beginning with what could be considered a Gauss sum for real fields, we construct explicit Galois annihilators of $\mathrm{Syl}_p(\mathfrak{C}_{\mathfrak{a}})$ akin to the classical Stickelberger Theorem.",math.NT,2015,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00968v3,Dynamic fairness-aware recommendation through multi-agent social choice,"Algorithmic fairness in the context of personalized recommendation presents significantly different challenges to those commonly encountered in classification tasks. Researchers studying classification have generally considered fairness to be a matter of achieving equality of outcomes between a protected and unprotected group, and built algorithmic interventions on this basis. We argue that fairness in real-world application settings in general, and especially in the context of personalized recommendation, is much more complex and multi-faceted, requiring a more general approach. We propose a model to formalize multistakeholder fairness in recommender systems as a two stage social choice problem. In particular, we express recommendation fairness as a novel combination of an allocation and an aggregation problem, which integrate both fairness concerns and personalized recommendation provisions, and derive new recommendation techniques based on this formulation. Simulations demonstrate the ability of the framework to integrate multiple fairness concerns in a dynamic way.",cs.AI,2023,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08621v2,Exploring Social Choice Mechanisms for Recommendation Fairness in SCRUF,"Fairness problems in recommender systems often have a complexity in practice that is not adequately captured in simplified research formulations. A social choice formulation of the fairness problem, operating within a multi-agent architecture of fairness concerns, offers a flexible and multi-aspect alternative to fairness-aware recommendation approaches. Leveraging social choice allows for increased generality and the possibility of tapping into well-studied social choice algorithms for resolving the tension between multiple, competing fairness concerns. This paper explores a range of options for choice mechanisms in multi-aspect fairness applications using both real and synthetic data and shows that different classes of choice and allocation mechanisms yield different but consistent fairness / accuracy tradeoffs. We also show that a multi-agent formulation offers flexibility in adapting to user population dynamics.","cs.IR,cs.AI",2023,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10219v1,Edit One for All: Interactive Batch Image Editing,"In recent years, image editing has advanced remarkably. With increased human control, it is now possible to edit an image in a plethora of ways; from specifying in text what we want to change, to straight up dragging the contents of the image in an interactive point-based manner. However, most of the focus has remained on editing single images at a time. Whether and how we can simultaneously edit large batches of images has remained understudied. With the goal of minimizing human supervision in the editing process, this paper presents a novel method for interactive batch image editing using StyleGAN as the medium. Given an edit specified by users in an example image (e.g., make the face frontal), our method can automatically transfer that edit to other test images, so that regardless of their initial state (pose), they all arrive at the same final state (e.g., all facing front). Extensive experiments demonstrate that edits performed using our method have similar visual quality to existing single-image-editing methods, while having more visual consistency and saving significant time and human effort.",cs.CV,2024,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0009090v2,Preserving entanglement under decoherence and sandwiching all separable states,"Every entangled state can be perturbed, for instance by decoherence, and stay entangled. For a large class of pure entangled states, we show how large the perturbation can be. Our class includes all pure bipartite and all maximally entangled states. For an entangled state, E, the constucted neighborhood of entangled states is the region outside two parallel hyperplanes, which sandwich the set of all separable states. The states for which these neighborhoods are largest are the maximally entangled ones. As the number of particles, or the dimensions of the Hilbert spaces for two of the particles increases, the distance between two of the hyperplanes which sandwich the separable states goes to zero. It is easy to decide if a state Q is in the neighborhood of entangled states we construct for an entangled state E. One merely has to check if the trace of EQ is greater than a constant which depends upon E and which we determine.",quant-ph,2000,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0105012v12,Standard and Hyperfinite Unifications for All Physical Theories,"In this paper, the set of all physical theories is represented by a countable subset of the lattice of consequence operators defined on a language L. It is established that there exists a unifying injection U defined on the set of significant representations for natural-systems M. If W is a member of M, then U selects an ultralogic C such that C(*W) restricted to L is a unification for the set of all physical theories as each is applied to W. There also exists a standard injection S that for each W in M selects a standard unifying consequence operator D, where C(*W) is a subset of *D(*W). It is also shown how to use these unifying operators and obtain a product operator that has the same effect but, in a practical sense, this operator is applied to every natural-system within our universe simultaneously.",physics.gen-ph,2001,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4029v3,All Multiparty Quantum States Can Be Made Monogamous,"Monogamy of quantum correlation measures puts restrictions on the sharability of quantum correlations in multiparty quantum states. Multiparty quantum states can satisfy or violate monogamy relations with respect to given quantum correlations. We show that all multiparty quantum states can be made monogamous with respect to all measures. More precisely, given any quantum correlation measure that is non-monogamic for a multiparty quantum state, it is always possible to find a monotonically increasing function of the measure that is monogamous for the same state. The statement holds for all quantum states, whether pure or mixed, in all finite dimensions and for an arbitrary number of parties. The monotonically increasing function of the quantum correlation measure satisfies all the properties that is expected for quantum correlations to follow. We illustrate the concepts by considering a thermodynamic measure of quantum correlation, called the quantum work deficit.",quant-ph,2012,human

The outcomes observe that AI innovation, renewable energy usage, and the digital economy reduce CO2 emissions, while GDP expansion and industrialization intensify ecosystem damage. Unit root tests (ADF, PP, and DF-GLS) reveal heterogeneous integration levels amongst components, ensuring robustness in the ARDL analysis. Complementary methods (FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR) validate the results, enhancing their reliability. Pairwise Granger causality assessments identify strong unidirectional connections within CO2 emissions and AI innovation, as well as the digital economy, underscoring their significant roles in ecological sustainability. This research highlights the requirement for strategic actions to nurture equitable growth, including advancements in AI technology, green energy adoption, and environmentally conscious industrial development, to improve environmental quality in the United States.","econ.GN,cs.AI,cs.CY",2025,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01376v1,Modeling All-Atom Glycan Structures via Hierarchical Message Passing and Multi-Scale Pre-training,"Understanding the various properties of glycans with machine learning has shown some preliminary promise. However, previous methods mainly focused on modeling the backbone structure of glycans as graphs of monosaccharides (i.e., sugar units), while they neglected the atomic structures underlying each monosaccharide, which are actually important indicators of glycan properties. We fill this blank by introducing the GlycanAA model for All-Atom-wise Glycan modeling. GlycanAA models a glycan as a heterogeneous graph with monosaccharide nodes representing its global backbone structure and atom nodes representing its local atomic-level structures. Based on such a graph, GlycanAA performs hierarchical message passing to capture from local atomic-level interactions to global monosaccharide-level interactions. To further enhance model capability, we pre-train GlycanAA on a high-quality unlabeled glycan dataset, deriving the PreGlycanAA model. We design a multi-scale mask prediction algorithm to endow the model about different levels of dependencies in a glycan. Extensive benchmark results show the superiority of GlycanAA over existing glycan encoders and verify the further improvements achieved by PreGlycanAA.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05174v1,Scaling Distributed All-Pairs Algorithms: Manage Computation and Limit Data Replication with Quorums,"In this paper we propose and prove that cyclic quorum sets can efficiently manage all-pairs computations and data replication. The quorums are O(N/sqrt(P)) in size, up to 50% smaller than the dual N/sqrt(P) array implementations, and significantly smaller than solutions requiring all data. Implementation evaluation demonstrated scalability on real datasets with a 7x speed up on 8 nodes with 1/3rd the memory usage per process. The all-pairs problem requires all data elements to be paired with all other data elements. These all-pair problems occur in many science fields, which has led to their continued interest. Additionally, as datasets grow in size, new methods like these that can reduce memory footprints and distribute work equally across compute nodes will be demanded.",cs.DC,2016,human

The Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST) is a mission concept, proposed for MIDEX, which would conduct the first imaging all-sky hard x-ray survey as well as provide a sensitive all sky monitor. With $\sim 60%$ sky coverage each orbit, and full sky coverage each 50 days, hard x-ray studies of gamma-ray bursts, AGN, galactic transients, x-ray binaries and accretion-powered pulsars can be conducted over a wide range of timescales. We summarize the scientific objectives of EXIST for both the survey and monitoring objectives. We describe the mission concept and the instrumentation approach, which would incorporate a large area array of Cd-Zn-Te (CZT) detectors, as well as some of our ongoing development of CZT array detectors.",astro-ph,1998,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04284v5,Improved Sample Complexities for Deep Networks and Robust Classification via an All-Layer Margin,"For linear classifiers, the relationship between (normalized) output margin and generalization is captured in a clear and simple bound -- a large output margin implies good generalization. Unfortunately, for deep models, this relationship is less clear: existing analyses of the output margin give complicated bounds which sometimes depend exponentially on depth. In this work, we propose to instead analyze a new notion of margin, which we call the ""all-layer margin."" Our analysis reveals that the all-layer margin has a clear and direct relationship with generalization for deep models. This enables the following concrete applications of the all-layer margin: 1) by analyzing the all-layer margin, we obtain tighter generalization bounds for neural nets which depend on Jacobian and hidden layer norms and remove the exponential dependency on depth 2) our neural net results easily translate to the adversarially robust setting, giving the first direct analysis of robust test error for deep networks, and 3) we present a theoretically inspired training algorithm for increasing the all-layer margin. Our algorithm improves both clean and adversarially robust test performance over strong baselines in practice.","cs.LG,stat.ML",2019,human

Its 22,000 m$^2$ instrumented area, wide field of view ($\sim$2 sr), and >95% uptime make it an ideal instrument for discovering gamma-ray burst (GRB) emission at $\sim$100 GeV. Such a discovery would provide key information about the origins of prompt GRB emission as well as constraints on extra-galactic background light (EBL) models and the violation of Lorentz invariance. We will present prospects for discovering GRB emission at $\sim$100 GeV with a simple, all-sky search algorithm using HAWC data that is most sensitive to short GRBs. The search algorithm presented here can also be used to detect other short transients with timescales and fluxes similar to short GRBs.",astro-ph.HE,2015,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22940v2,One-to-All Animation: Alignment-Free Character Animation and Image Pose Transfer,"Recent advances in diffusion models have greatly improved pose-driven character animation. However, existing methods are limited to spatially aligned reference-pose pairs with matched skeletal structures. Handling reference-pose misalignment remains unsolved. To address this, we present One-to-All Animation, a unified framework for high-fidelity character animation and image pose transfer for references with arbitrary layouts. First, to handle spatially misaligned reference, we reformulate training as a self-supervised outpainting task that transforms diverse-layout reference into a unified occluded-input format. Second, to process partially visible reference, we design a reference extractor for comprehensive identity feature extraction. Further, we integrate hybrid reference fusion attention to handle varying resolutions and dynamic sequence lengths. Finally, from the perspective of generation quality, we introduce identity-robust pose control that decouples appearance from skeletal structure to mitigate pose overfitting, and a token replace strategy for coherent long-video generation. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches. The code and model are available at https://github.com/ssj9596/One-to-All-Animation.",cs.CV,2025,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00356v1,All-frequency Full-body Human Image Relighting,"Relighting of human images enables post-photography editing of lighting effects in portraits. The current mainstream approach uses neural networks to approximate lighting effects without explicitly accounting for the principle of physical shading. As a result, it often has difficulty representing high-frequency shadows and shading. In this paper, we propose a two-stage relighting method that can reproduce physically-based shadows and shading from low to high frequencies. The key idea is to approximate an environment light source with a set of a fixed number of area light sources. The first stage employs supervised inverse rendering from a single image using neural networks and calculates physically-based shading. The second stage then calculates shadow for each area light and sums up to render the final image. We propose to make soft shadow mapping differentiable for the area-light approximation of environment lighting. We demonstrate that our method can plausibly reproduce all-frequency shadows and shading caused by environment illumination, which have been difficult to reproduce using existing methods.","cs.GR,cs.CV",2024,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10439v5,Weyl group covers for Brieskorn's resolutions in all characteristics and the integral cohomology of $G/P$,"We unify results of Artin, Brieskorn, Slodowy and others by showing that, in all characteristics, the Artin component of the deformation space of a rational surface singularity has a ramified cover where simultaneous resolution exists and the Galois group of this cover is the Weyl group determined by the configuration of $(-2)$-curves in the minimal resolution. This verifies a conjecture made by Burns and Rapoport. We use an integral version of this to show that certain actions of Weyl groups on polynomial rings over the integers give rings of invariants that are also polynomial, and deduce that the integral cohomology rings of complete flag varieties $G/B$ of types $A,D$ or $E$ can be described as the corresponding rings of co-invariants.",math.AG,2017,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12134v1,"Every Flare, Everywhere: An All-Sky Untriggered Search for Astrophysical Neutrino Transients Using IceCube Data","Recent results from IceCube regarding TXS 0506+056 suggest the presence of neutrino flares that are not temporally coincident with a significant corresponding gamma ray flare. Such flares are particularly difficult to identify, as their presence must be inferred from the temporal distribution of neutrino data alone. Here we present the results of using a novel method to search for all such flares across the entire neutrino sky in 10 years of IceCube data, using both Gaussian and box-shaped flare hypotheses. Unlike for past searches, that looked for only the most significant neutrino flare in the data at a given direction, here we implement an algorithm to combine information from multiple flares associated with a single source candidate. This represents the most detailed description of the neutrino sky to date, providing the location and intensity of all neutrino cluster candidates in both space and time. These results can be used to further constrain potential populations of transient neutrino sources, serving as a complement to existing time-integrated and time-dependent methods.",astro-ph.HE,2021,human

http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2928v2,Highly Efficient Quantum Key Distribution Immune to All Detector Attacks,"Vulnerabilities and imperfections of single-photon detectors have been shown to compromise security for quantum key distribution (QKD). The measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD) appears to be the most appealing solution to solve the issues. However, in practice one faces severe obstacles of having significantly lower key generation rate, difficult two photon interferences, and remote synchronization etc. In this letter, we propose a highly efficient and simple quantum key distribution scheme to remove all of these drawbacks. Our proposal can be implemented with only small modifications over the standard decoy BB84 system. Remarkably it enjoys both the advantages of high key generation rate (being almost two orders of magnitude higher than that based on conventional MDI-QKD) comparable to the normal decoy system, and security against any detector side channel attacks. Most favorably one can achieve complete Bell state measurements with resort to single photon interference, which reduces significantly experimental costs. Our approach enables utilization of high speed and efficient secure communication, particularly in real-life scenario of both metropolitan and intercity QKD network, with an attack free fashion from arbitrary detector side channels.",quant-ph,2014,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00836v2,Modeling all alternative solutions for highly renewable energy systems,"As the world is transitioning towards highly renewable energy systems, advanced tools are needed to analyze such complex networks. Energy system design is, however, challenged by real-world objective functions consisting of a blurry mix of technical and socioeconomic agendas, with limitations that cannot always be clearly stated. As a result, it is highly likely that solutions which are techno-economically suboptimal will be preferable. Here, we present a method capable of determining the continuum containing all techno-economically near-optimal solutions, moving the field of energy system modeling from discrete solutions to a new era where continuous solution ranges are available. The presented method is applied to study a range of technical and socioeconomic metrics on a model of the European electricity system. The near-optimal region is found to be relatively flat allowing for solutions that are slightly more expensive than the optimum but better in terms of equality, land use, and implementation time.",cs.CE,2020,human

Here we demonstrate excellent qubit device uniformity and tunability from 300K down to mK temperatures. This is achieved, for the first time, by integrating an overlapping polycrystalline silicon-based gate stack in an 'all-Silicon' and lithographically flexible 300mm flow. Low-disorder Si/SiO$_2$ is proved by a 10K Hall mobility of $1.5 \cdot 10^4$ $cm^2$/Vs. Well-controlled sensors with low charge noise (3.6 $μ$eV/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 1 Hz) are used for charge sensing down to the last electron. We demonstrate excellent and reproducible interdot coupling control over nearly 2 decades (2-100 GHz). We show spin manipulation and single-shot spin readout, extracting a valley splitting energy of around 150 $μ$eV.

Previous work in this area has often been limited by fixed, single-objective definitions of fairness, built into algorithms or optimization criteria that are applied to a single fairness dimension or, at most, applied identically across dimensions. These narrow conceptualizations limit the ability to adapt fairness-aware solutions to the wide range of stakeholder needs and fairness definitions that arise in practice. Our work approaches recommendation fairness from the standpoint of computational social choice, using a multi-agent framework. In this paper, we explore the properties of different social choice mechanisms and demonstrate the successful integration of multiple, heterogeneous fairness definitions across multiple data sets.","cs.IR,cs.CY,cs.LG",2024,human

First, the natural map from the relative outer space ${\mathscr O}(Γ;\mathscr A)$ to the relative free splitting complex $\mathcal{FS}(Γ;\mathscr A)$ is coarsely Lipschitz, with respect to the log-Lipschitz semimetric on~${\mathscr O}(Γ;\mathscr A)$. Second, if $φ\in \text{Out}(Γ;\mathscr A)$ has a filling attracting lamination with expansion factor $λ>1$ then the stable translation length of $φ$ acting on $\mathcal{FS}(Γ;\mathscr A)$ has an upper bound of the form~$B \log(λ)$.",math.GR,2022,human

In these limitations lie fundamental solutions for the communication of multimedia systems. As such, subjects were asked to evaluate the perceptual quality of static images presented on a TV screen while their head was in a dynamic (moving) state. The idea is potentially applicable to virtual reality applications and therefore, we also measured the image quality perception of each subject on a head mounted display.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20370v1,InvZW: Invariant Feature Learning via Noise-Adversarial Training for Robust Image Zero-Watermarking,"This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for robust image zero-watermarking based on distortion-invariant feature learning. As a zero-watermarking scheme, our method leaves the original image unaltered and learns a reference signature through optimization in the feature space. The proposed framework consists of two key modules. In the first module, a feature extractor is trained via noise-adversarial learning to generate representations that are both invariant to distortions and semantically expressive. This is achieved by combining adversarial supervision against a distortion discriminator and a reconstruction constraint to retain image content. In the second module, we design a learning-based multibit zero-watermarking scheme where the trained invariant features are projected onto a set of trainable reference codes optimized to match a target binary message. Extensive experiments on diverse image datasets and a wide range of distortions show that our method achieves state-of-the-art robustness in both feature stability and watermark recovery.

We show that the curve integral manifests a very surprising fact about these amplitudes: the dependence on the number of particles, $n$, and the loop order, $L$, is effectively decoupled. We derive the curve integrals at tree-level for all $n$. We then show that, for higher loop-order, it suffices to study the curve integrals for $L$-loop tadpole-like amplitudes, which have just one particle per color trace-factor. By combining these tadpole-like formulas with the the tree-level result, we find formulas for the all $n$ amplitudes at $L$ loops. We illustrate this result by giving explicit curve integrals for all the amplitudes in the theory, including the non-planar amplitudes, through to two loops, for all $n$.",hep-th,2023,human

The data set used in the analysis corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb$^{-1}$. The large multi-jet background is modelled using a data-driven method. The top-quark mass is obtained from template fits to the ratio of the three-jet to the dijet mass. The three-jet mass is obtained from the three jets assigned to the top quark decay. From these three jets the dijet mass is obtained using the two jets assigned to the W boson decay. The top-quark mass is measured to be 173.72 $\pm$ 0.55 (stat.) $\pm$ 1.01 (syst.)

A manufacturer makes a single product that requires mixing/assembling multiple ingredients/components with pre-determined blending ratios. We consider a single supplier offering quantity-based discounts which introduces non-linearities to the problem. The objective is to minimize procurement cost which includes purchasing, inventory, and ordering costs. We develop a solution procedure that systematically generates a finite dominating set (FDS) of order quantities guaranteed to include an optimal solution to the problem. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model based on the FDS. Our procedure guarantees optimality and eliminates the need for nonlinear discount modeling. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed MILP achieves optimal solutions with significantly reduced computational effort, up to 99% faster for large-scale instances compared to conventional formulations. Sensitivity analyses reveal that the model dynamically adapts to changes in holding costs, shifting between bulk-purchasing and just-in-time strategies, and identifying cost-sensitive ingredients that drive total system cost.",math.OC,2025,human

http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14988v1,Asymmetric All-or-nothing Transforms,"In this paper, we initiate a study of asymmetric all-or-nothing transforms (or asymmetric AONTs). A (symmetric) $t$-all-or-nothing transform is a bijective mapping defined on the set of $s$-tuples over a specified finite alphabet. It is required that knowledge of all but $t$ outputs leaves any $t$ inputs completely undetermined. There have been numerous papers developing the theory of AONTs as well as presenting various applications of AONTs in cryptography and information security.   In this paper, we replace the parameter $t$ by two parameters $t_o$ and $t_i$, where $t_i \leq t_o$. The requirement is that knowledge of all but $t_o$ outputs leaves any $t_i$ inputs completely undetermined. When $t_i < t_o$, we refer to the AONT as asymmetric.   We give several constructions and bounds for various classes of asymmetric AONTs, especially those with $t_i = 1$ or $t_i = 2$. We pay particular attention to linear transforms, where the alphabet is a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and the mapping is linear.","math.CO,cs.CR",2021,human

However, IPv4 Internet scans have been limited to scanning only a subset of services -- exhaustively scanning all IPv4 services is too costly and no existing bandwidth-saving frameworks are designed to scan IPv4 addresses across all ports. In this work we introduce GPS, a system that efficiently discovers Internet services across all ports. GPS runs a predictive framework that learns from extremely small sample sizes and is highly parallelizable, allowing it to quickly find patterns between services across all 65K ports and a myriad of features. GPS computes service predictions in 13 minutes (four orders of magnitude faster than prior work) and finds 92.5% of services across all ports with 131x less bandwidth, and 204x more precision, compared to exhaustive scanning. GPS is the first work to show that, given at least two responsive IP addresses on a port to train from, predicting the majority of services across all ports is possible and practical.","cs.NI,cs.DC,cs.LG",2023,human

Focusing on a 3-level Tavis-Cummings model in a far detuned limit, we detail its deep Hilbert space structure -- i.e. we enumerate all distinct dynamical sectors, beyond the totally symmetric subspace -- by using the Schur-Weyl duality, which is applicable thanks to the permutation symmetry in the all-to-all Hamiltonian. Strong Hilbert space fragmentation ensues from the non-abelian nature of the symmetry, with some sectors displaying regular dynamics and others being chaotic. We uncover that many permutation symmetry sectors contribute to the dynamics in the classical limit, in addition to the commonly studied totally symmetric subspace. To elucidate the dynamical responses in each of the symmetry sectors, we propose a semiclassical description in terms of spin coherent states, which is also able to explain the origin of chaotic or regular dynamics with a simple geometrical argument.

The proposed method addresses the challenge of handling the case of continuous conditions, which often involve a large set of conditions with sparse empirical observations per condition. We introduce a novel cost function that enables simultaneous learning of optimal transports for all pairs of conditional distributions. Our method is supported by a theoretical guarantee that, in the limit, it converges to the pairwise optimal transports among infinite pairs of conditional distributions. The learned transport maps are subsequently used to couple data points in conditional flow matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on synthetic and benchmark datasets, as well as on chemical datasets in which continuous physical properties are defined as conditions.

We prove that for any $m>1$, every finite solvable group which is a union of conjugates of $m$ proper subgroups (where all these conjugates have trivial intersection) occurs as the Galois group of such a polynomial, and that the same result (with $m=2$) holds for all Frobenius groups. It is also observed that every nonsolvable Frobenius group is realizable as the Galois group of a geometric--i.e. regular-- extension of $\dQ(t)$.",math.NT,2006,human

These are evaluated within a software framework, and the results are used to identify the most promising formulations and decomposition techniques. These best approaches are then mapped to the all-to-all hardware, and the performance of 3SAT is evaluated on the chip. Experimental data shows that the deployed decomposition and mapping strategies impact SAT solution quality: without our methods, the CMOS hardware cannot achieve 3SAT solutions on SATLIB benchmarks.",cs.ET,2023,human

In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm for computing the all-paths kernel which is very efficient and enrich it further by including the simple cycles as well. We demonstrate how it is feasible even on large datasets to compute all the paths and simple cycles up to a moderate length. We show how to count labelled paths/simple cycles between vertices of a graph and evaluate a labelled path and simple cycles kernel. Extensive evaluations on a variety of graph datasets demonstrate that the all-paths and cycles kernel has superior performance to the shortest-path kernel and state-of-the-art performance overall.",cs.LG,2017,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4711v1,Finding All Allowed Edges in a Bipartite Graph,"We consider the problem of finding all allowed edges in a bipartite graph $G=(V,E)$, i.e., all edges that are included in some maximum matching. We show that given any maximum matching in the graph, it is possible to perform this computation in linear time $O(n+m)$ (where $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$). Hence, the time complexity of finding all allowed edges reduces to that of finding a single maximum matching, which is $O(n^{1/2}m)$ [Hopcroft and Karp 1973], or $O((n/\log n)^{1/2}m)$ for dense graphs with $m=Θ(n^2)$ [Alt et al. 1991]. This time complexity improves upon that of the best known algorithms for the problem, which is $O(nm)$ ([Costa 1994] for bipartite graphs, and [Carvalho and Cheriyan 2005] for general graphs). Other algorithms for solving that problem are randomized algorithms due to [Rabin and Vazirani 1989] and [Cheriyan 1997], the runtime of which is $\tilde{O}(n^{2.376})$. Our algorithm, apart from being deterministic, improves upon that time complexity for bipartite graphs when $m=O(n^r)$ and $r<1.876$. In addition, our algorithm is elementary, conceptually simple, and easy to implement.",cs.DM,2011,human

Most of results are focused on the nonlocalities of quantum networks. Our goal in this work is to explore new characterizations of any networks with theory-independent configurations. We firstly prove the configuration inequality for any network using the fractional independent set of the associated graph. These inequalities can be built with polynomial-time complexity. The new result allows featuring correlations of any classical network depending only on its network topology. Similar inequalities hold for all entangled quantum networks with any local measurements. This shows an inherent feature of quantum networks under local unitary operations. It is then applied for verifying almost all multipartite entangled pure states with linear complexity, and witnessing quantum network topology without assumption of inputs. The configuration theory is further extended for any no-signalling networks. These results may be interesting in entanglement theory, quantum information processing, and quantum networks.",quant-ph,2021,human

The third one walks around the state space of the problem in a systematic way and produces all the minimal sets of the advantageous initial species, and works also for large systems.

The electronic system is described by the Hubbard model with an anti-symmetric spin-orbit coupling. The AIAO spin ordered state is formed by arranging tetrahedral hedgehog spin-clusters uniformly in the lattice system, where 12 types of spin-clusters are allowed in a unit cell. All spin-cluster susceptibilities are calculated within the random phase approximation with respect to the onsite electron interaction. It is shown that, for the negative spin-orbit coupling coefficient, the AIAO spin-cluster susceptibility diverges at q=0, while other types of spin-cluster susceptibilities are not developed and are structureless. By calculating the superconducting transition mediated by AIAO spin fluctuation, it is found that a spin-triplet superconductivity appears, while there is no signal of superconducting transition for the spin-singlet one. We suggest that the spin-triplet superconductivity appears around the AIAO spin ordered phase in the pyrochlore lattice.","cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.supr-con",2024,human

Random structure sampling reveals that for all three systems the rocksalt local minimum on the potential energy surface is far larger than any other, making it statistically the most significant structure. The kinetics modeling shows that virtually all other relevant structures, including most of the 457 known A$_1$B$_1$ prototypes, transform rapidly to rocksalt, making it the only option at ambient conditions.

However, not all requests posed to LLMs are equally difficult to handle. Through analysis, we show that for some tasks, LLMs can achieve results comparable to the final output at some intermediate layers. That is, not all layers of LLMs are necessary during inference. If we can predict at which layer the inferred results match the final results (produced by evaluating all layers), we could significantly reduce the inference cost. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm named AdaInfer to adaptively terminate the inference process for an input instance. AdaInfer relies on easily obtainable statistical features and classic classifiers like SVM. Experiments on well-known LLMs like the Llama2 series and OPT, show that AdaInfer can achieve an average of 17.8% pruning ratio, and up to 43% on sentiment tasks, with nearly no performance drop (<1%). Because AdaInfer does not alter LLM parameters, the LLMs incorporated with AdaInfer maintain generalizability across tasks.","cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.LG",2024,human

All-to-all quark propagators are expected to be needed when studying these excited states on light, dynamical configurations because contributions from multi-particle states are expected to be significant. The dilution method is used to approximate the all-to-all quark propagators. Low-lying eigenmodes can also be used if necessary. For efficient computation of matrix elements of the interpolating operators, the algorithms should exploit the fact that many extended baryon operators can be obtained from the different linear combinations of three-quark colour-singlet operators. The sparseness of the diluted noise vectors also afford several computation simplifications. Some preliminary results are presented for nucleon effective masses.",hep-lat,2007,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.6202v2,"On the notion of ""the same physics in all spacetimes""","Brunetti, Fredenhagen and Verch (BFV) have shown how the notion of local covariance for quantum field theories can be formulated in terms of category theory: a theory being described as a functor from a category of spacetimes to a category of $(C)^*$-algebras. We discuss whether this condition is sufficient to guarantee that a theory represents `the same physics' in all spacetimes, giving examples to show that it does not. A new criterion, dynamical locality, is formulated, which requires that descriptions of local physics based on kinematical and dynamical considerations should coincide. Various applications are given, including a proof that dynamical locality for quantum fields is incompatible with the possibility of covariantly choosing a preferred state in each spacetime. As part of this discussion we state a precise condition that should hold on any class of theories each representing the same physics in all spacetimes. This condition holds for the dynamically local theories but is violated by the full class of locally covariant theories in the BFV sense.

Previously, the special cases of this statement for certain $X$ were usually proved using the equivartiant obstruction theory. Such calculations are difficult and may become infeasible past the first (primary) obstruction. We take a different approach which allows us to prove the vanishing of all obstructions simultaneously. The essential step in the proof is classifying the possible degrees of $\mathfrak S_n$-equivariant maps from the boundary $\partialΔ^{n-1}$ of $(n-1)$-simplex to itself.   Existence of equivariant maps between spaces is important for many questions arising from discrete mathematics and geometry, such as Kneser's conjecture, the Square Peg conjecture, the Splitting Necklace problem, and the Topological Tverberg conjecture, etc. We demonstrate the utility of our result applying it to one such question, a specific instance of envy-free division problem.","math.GT,math.AT",2019,human

However, all-to-all attention tends to generate distorted style patterns and has quadratic complexity, limiting the effectiveness and efficiency of arbitrary style transfer. In this paper, we propose a novel all-to-key attention mechanism -- each position of content features is matched to stable key positions of style features -- that is more in line with the characteristics of style transfer. Specifically, it integrates two newly proposed attention forms: distributed and progressive attention. Distributed attention assigns attention to key style representations that depict the style distribution of local regions; Progressive attention pays attention from coarse-grained regions to fine-grained key positions. The resultant module, dubbed StyA2K, shows extraordinary performance in preserving the semantic structure and rendering consistent style patterns.

Using the bivector approach it is shown in this article a classification for the Weyl tensor in all four-dimensional manifolds, including all signatures and the complex case, in an unified and simple way. The important Petrov classification then emerges just as a particular case in this scheme. The boost weight classification is also extended here to all signatures as well to complex manifolds. For the Weyl tensor in four dimensions it is established that this last approach produces a classification equivalent to the one generated by the bivector method.","gr-qc,hep-th,math.DG",2012,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6472v3,Hard-Soft-Collinear Factorization to All Orders,"We provide a precise statement of hard-soft-collinear factorization of scattering amplitudes and prove it to all orders in perturbation theory. Factorization is formulated as the equality at leading power of scattering amplitudes in QCD with other amplitudes in QCD computed from a product of operator matrix elements. The equivalence is regulator independent and gauge independent. As the formulation relates amplitudes to the same amplitudes with additional soft or collinear particles, it includes as special cases the factorization of soft currents and collinear splitting functions from generic matrix elements, both of which are shown to be process independent to all orders. We show that the overlapping soft-collinear region is naturally accounted for by vacuum matrix elements of kinked Wilson lines. Although the proof is self-contained, it combines techniques developed for the study of pinch surfaces, scattering amplitudes, and effective field theory.",hep-ph,2014,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08113v2,All point correlation functions in SYK,"Large $N$ melonic theories are characterized by two-point function Feynman diagrams built exclusively out of melons. This leads to conformal invariance at strong coupling, four-point function diagrams that are exclusively ladders, and higher-point functions that are built out of four-point functions joined together. We uncover an incredibly useful property of these theories: the six-point function, or equivalently, the three-point function of the primary $O(N)$ invariant bilinears, regarded as an analytic function of the operator dimensions, fully determines all correlation functions, to leading nontrivial order in $1/N$, through simple Feynman-like rules. The result is applicable to any theory, not necessarily melonic, in which higher-point correlators are built out of four-point functions. We explicitly calculate the bilinear three-point function for $q$-body SYK, at any $q$. This leads to the bilinear four-point function, as well as all higher-point functions, expressed in terms of higher-point conformal blocks, which we discuss. We find universality of correlators of operators of large dimension, which we simplify through a saddle point analysis. We comment on the implications for the AdS dual of SYK.","hep-th,cond-mat.str-el",2017,human

The result is surprising: an explicit polynomial of degree $n$, the rank of the group, encodes the volume entropy of all classical presentations of surface groups. The approach we use is completely different. It is based on a dynamical system construction following an idea due to Bowen and Series and extended to all geometric presentations in. The result is an explicit formula for the volume entropy of minimal presentations for all surface groups, showing a polynomial dependence in the rank $n>2$. We prove that for a surface group $G_n$ of rank $n$ with a classical presentation $P_n$ the volume entropy is $\log(λ_n)$, where $λ_n$ is the unique real root larger than one of the polynomial \[ x^{n} - 2(n - 1) \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} x^{j} + 1. \]",math.DS,2014,human

In $d+Au$ collisions, the physics of particle production at any $η$ is basically the same as at $η=0$. The Cronin effect is described as a result of the final-state instead of the initial-state interaction. The suppression of $R_{CP}$ at high $η$ is due to the reduction of the soft parton density on the deuteron side, thus resulting in less pions produced by recombination, an explanation that requires no new physics. In $Au+Au$ collisions large $p/π$ ratio is obtained because the thermal partons can contribute to the formation of proton more than they do to the pion.",nucl-th,2005,human

In this paper, we show that all unconstrained strongly convex problems are $C^0$ weakly simplicial.

Two essential ingredients are required for this construction: (1) The superalgebras, which extend the adS algebra for different dimensions, and (2) the lagrangians, which are Chern-Simons $(2n-1)$-forms. The first item completes the analysis of van Holten and Van Proeyen, which was valid for N=1 only. The second ensures that the actions are invariant by construction under the gauge supergroup and, in particular, under local supersymmetry. Thus, unlike standard supergravity, the local supersymmetry algebra closes off-shell and without requiring auxiliary fields. \\   The superalgebras are constructed for all dimensions and they fall into three families: $osp(m|N)$ for $D=2,3,4$, mod 8, $osp(N|m)$ for $D=6,7,8$, mod 8, and $su(m-2,2|N)$ for D=5 mod 4, with $m=2^{[D/2]}$.

Here, we introduce a framework for network-assisted self-testing and use it to self-test any pure entangled quantum state of an arbitrary number of systems. The scheme requires the preparation of a number of singlets that scales linearly with the number of systems, and the implementation of standard projective and Bell measurements, all feasible with current technology.

The directional propagation of the photons in such baths enables perfect destructive interference, forming what we denote as \emph{qubit-photon corner states}.

Moreover, it is very desirable for the device elements to be detachable, allowing components to be built, tested, and replaced independently. In this work, we present a microwave quantum state router, centered on parametrically driven, Josephson-junction based three-wave mixing, that realizes all-to-all couplings among four detachable quantum modules. We demonstrate coherent exchange among all four communication modes, with an average full-iSWAP time of 764ns and average inferred inter-module exchange fidelity of 0.969, limited by mode coherence. We also demonstrate photon transfer and pairwise entanglement between module qubits, and parallel operation of simultaneous iSWAP exchange across the router. Our router-module architecture serves as a prototype of modular quantum computer that has great potential for enabling flexible, demountable, large-scale quantum networks of superconducting qubits and cavities.",quant-ph,2021,human

Although this question has undoubtedly lingered for as long as humans have walked the Earth, the answer still eludes us.

In this brief essay, I describe some of my own past and ongoing work on this topic, centering on cosmological inflation. I focus on   (1) observationally testing whether this picture is correct and   (2) working out implications for the nature of physical reality (e.g., the global structure of spacetime, dark energy and our cosmic future, parallel universes and fundamental versus environmental physical laws).   (2) clearly requires (1) to determine whether to believe the conclusions.

Can these small quantities all be traced to a single source and, if so, how could that be tested? Here a see-saw model for neutrino masses is presented wherein a dominant term generates the atmospheric mass splitting with maximal mixing in this sector, keeping $θ_{13} = 0$ and zero solar splitting. A Type-I see-saw perturbative contribution results in non-zero values of $θ_{13}$, $Δm^2_{solar}$, $θ_{12}$, as well as allows $θ_{23}$ to deviate from $π/4$ in consistency with the data while interrelating them all. CP-violation is a natural consequence and is large ($δ\sim π/2, 3π/2$) for inverted mass ordering. The model will be tested as precision on the neutrino parameters is sharpened.","hep-ph,hep-ex",2014,human

http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08787v3,SpatialFlow: Bridging All Tasks for Panoptic Segmentation,"Object location is fundamental to panoptic segmentation as it is related to all things and stuff in the image scene. Knowing the locations of objects in the image provides clues for segmenting and helps the network better understand the scene. How to integrate object location in both thing and stuff segmentation is a crucial problem. In this paper, we propose spatial information flows to achieve this objective. The flows can bridge all sub-tasks in panoptic segmentation by delivering the object's spatial context from the box regression task to others. More importantly, we design four parallel sub-networks to get a preferable adaptation of object spatial information in sub-tasks. Upon the sub-networks and the flows, we present a location-aware and unified framework for panoptic segmentation, denoted as SpatialFlow. We perform a detailed ablation study on each component and conduct extensive experiments to prove the effectiveness of SpatialFlow. Furthermore, we achieve state-of-the-art results, which are $47.9$ PQ and $62.5$ PQ respectively on MS-COCO and Cityscapes panoptic benchmarks.

In this work, we note another coincidence: the Lanczos algorithm is equivalent to the well-known Rayleigh-Ritz method applied to Krylov subspaces. Rayleigh-Ritz provides optimal eigenvalue approximations within subspaces; we find that spurious-state filtering allows these optimality guarantees to be retained in the presence of statistical noise. We explore the relation between Lanczos and Prony's method, their block generalizations, generalized pencil of functions (GPOF), and methods based on the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP), and find they all fall into a larger ""Prony-Ritz equivalence class"", identified as all methods which solve a finite-dimensional spectrum exactly given sufficient correlation function (matrix) data. This equivalence allows simpler and more numerically stable implementations of (block) Lanczos analyses.","hep-lat,math.NA",2025,human

This class of models includes the Bernoulli group testing model and the planted Gaussian perceptron model. Previously, the existence of the all-or-nothing phenomenon for such models was only known in a limited range of parameters. Our work extends the results to all signals with arbitrary sublinear sparsity.   Over the past several years, the all-or-nothing phenomenon has been established in various models as an outcome of two seemingly disjoint results: one positive result establishing the ""all"" half of all-or-nothing, and one impossibility result establishing the ""nothing"" half. Our main technique in the present work is to show that for noiseless discrete channels, the ""all"" half implies the ""nothing"" half, that is a proof of ""all"" can be turned into a proof of ""nothing."" Since the ""all"" half can often be proven by straightforward means -- for instance, by the first-moment method -- our equivalence gives a powerful and general approach towards establishing the existence of this phenomenon in other contexts.","math.ST,cs.IT,math.PR",2021,human

Because most of the qubit interactions are two-body interactions, Lechner also proposed the construction of each four-body interaction by six controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates between two qubits. However, it is difficult to construct many CNOT gates. Herein, we show more concrete sequences to produce four-body and three-body interactions based on a two-dimensional solid-state qubit system. We show that the number of operations needed to construct the many-body interactions can be reduced using appropriate pulse sequences.

The Jacobi identities imply that such deformations are uniquely determined by a single tensor that belongs to the same representation of the internal symmetry group as the $D-1$ forms specified by $E_{11}$. The non-linear realisation of the deformed algebra gives the field strengths of the theory which are those of any possible gauged maximal supergravity theory in any dimension. All the possible deformed algebras are in one to one correspondence with all the possible massive maximal supergravity theories. The hierarchy of fields inherent in the $E_{11}$ formulation plays an important role in the derivation. The tensor that determines the deformation can be identified with the embedding tensor used previously to parameterise gauged supergravities. Thus we provide a very efficient, simple and unified derivation of the bosonic sector, and in the absence of gravity, of all maximal gauged supergravities from $E_{11}$.",hep-th,2009,human

Although transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers exhibit near-unity PL QY at low exciton densities, nonradiative exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) enhanced by van-Hove singularity (VHS) rapidly degrades their PL QY at high exciton densities and limits their utility in practical applications. Here, by applying small mechanical strain (< 1%), we circumvent VHS resonance and drastically suppress EEA in monolayer TMDCs, resulting in near-unity PL QY at all exciton densities despite the presence of a high native defect density.

Nanoparticles can exhibit enhanced light absorption under illumination by light, and they become nanoscale sources of heat that can be precisely controlled and manipulated. For metal nanoparticles, such effects have been studied in the framework of $\textit{thermoplasmonics}$ which, similar to plasmonics itself, has a number of limitations. Recently emerged $\textit{all-dielectric resonant nanophotonics}$ is associated with optically-induced electric and magnetic Mie resonances, and this field is developing very rapidly in the last decade. As a result, thermoplasmonics is being replaced by $\textit{all-dielectric thermonanophotonics}$ with many important applications such as photothermal cancer therapy, drug and gene delivery, nanochemistry, and photothermal imaging. This review paper aims to introduce this new field of non-plasmonic nanophotonics and discuss associated thermally-induced processes at the nanoscale.","physics.optics,physics.app-ph",2021,human

We propose a new type of molecular motor based on electric field actuation and electric current detection of the rotational motion of a molecular dipole embedded in a three-terminal single-molecule device. The key aspect of this all-electronic design is the conjugated backbone of the molecule, which simultaneously provides the potential landscape of the rotor orientation and a real-time measure of that orientation through the modulation of the conductivity. Using quantum chemistry calculations, we show that this approach provides full control over the speed and continuity of motion, thereby combining electrical and mechanical control at the molecular level over a wide range of temperatures. Moreover, chemistry can be used to change all key parameters of the device, enabling a variety of new experiments on molecular motors.","cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.stat-mech",2010,human

The independence number alpha(G) is the cardinality of a maximum independent set, while mu(G) is the size of a maximum matching in G. If alpha(G)+mu(G)=|V|, then G=(V,E) is called a Konig-Egervary graph. The number d_{c}(G)=max{|A|-|N(A)|} is called the critical difference of G (Zhang, 1990). By core(G) (corona(G)) we denote the intersection (union, respectively) of all maximum independent sets, while by ker(G) we mean the intersection of all critical independent sets. A connected graph having only one cycle is called unicyclic. It is known that ker(G) is a subset of core(G) for every graph G, while the equality is true for bipartite graphs (Levit and Mandrescu, 2011). For Konig-Egervary unicyclic graphs, the difference |core(G)|-|ker(G)| may equal any non-negative integer. In this paper we prove that if G is a non-Konig-Egervary unicyclic graph, then: (i) ker(G)= core(G) and (ii) |corona(G)|+|core(G)|=2*alpha(G)+1.

Second, we both expand the current evaluation dictionary collection to include all language pairs using triangulation, and also create new dictionaries for under-represented languages. Evaluating established methods over all these language pairs sheds light into their suitability and presents new challenges for the field.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02438v3,No second law of entanglement manipulation after all,"Many fruitful analogies have emerged between the theories of quantum entanglement and thermodynamics, motivating the pursuit of an axiomatic description of entanglement akin to the laws of thermodynamics. A long-standing open problem has been to establish a true second law of entanglement, and in particular a unique function which governs all transformations between entangled systems, mirroring the role of entropy in thermodynamics. Contrary to previous promising evidence, here we show that this is impossible, and no direct counterpart to the second law of thermodynamics can be established. This is accomplished by demonstrating the irreversibility of entanglement theory from first principles -- assuming only the most general microscopic physical constraints of entanglement manipulation, we show that entanglement theory is irreversible under all non-entangling transformations. We furthermore rule out reversibility without significant entanglement expenditure, showing that reversible entanglement transformations require the generation of macroscopically large amounts of entanglement according to certain measures. Our results not only reveal fundamental differences between quantum entanglement transformations and thermodynamic processes, but also showcase a unique property of entanglement which distinguishes it from other known quantum resources.","quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech,math-ph",2021,human

Although sample-efficient, information-theoretic benchmarking techniques have recently been proposed, there is still a gap in adapting these techniques to contemporary experiments. In this work, we re-formulate five of the most common randomized benchmarking techniques in the modern language of the gate-set shadow tomography. This reformulation brings along several concrete advantages over conventional formulations of randomized benchmarking. For standard and interleaved randomized benchmarking, we can reduce the required gate-set size and, using median-of-means estimators, also reduce the required experimental sample size. For simultaneous and correlated randomized benchmarking, we can additionally reconstruct the Pauli-terms of correlated noise channels using additional post-processing of only a single experimental dataset. We also present a minimal approach to extract leakage errors. Our work provides a clear avenue for comprehensive, reliable, and convenient benchmarking of quantum devices, with all methods formulated under a single umbrella technique that can be easily adapted to a range of experimental quantities and gate sets.",quant-ph,2025,human

Under a small magnetic field, the magnon bands of the pyrochlore with AIAO background can feature two opposite-charged Weyl points, which is the minimal number of Weyl points realizable in quantum materials and has not be experimentally observed so far. We further show that breathing pyrochlores with AIAO orders can exhibit Weyl magnons upon uniaxial strains. These findings apply to any pyrochlore material supporting AIAO orders, irrespective of the forms of interactions. Specifically, we show that the Weyl magnons are robust against direct (positive) Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Because of the ubiquitous AIAO orders in pyrochlore magnets including R$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, and experimentally achievable external strain and magnetic field, our predictions provide promising arena to witness the Weyl magnons in quantum magnets.","cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci",2017,human

This is accomplished using the gauge bundle required in any heterotic compactification, whose perturbative effects on the moduli are combined with non-perturbative corrections. We argue that, for appropriate gauge bundles, all complex structure and a large number of other moduli can be perturbatively stabilized - in the most restrictive case, leaving only one combination of Kahler moduli and the dilaton as a flat direction. At this stage, the remaining moduli space consists of Minkowski vacua. That is, the perturbative superpotential vanishes in the vacuum without the necessity to fine-tune flux. Finally, we incorporate non-perturbative effects such as gaugino condensation and/or instantons. These are strongly constrained by the anomalous U(1) symmetries which arise from the required bundle constructions.

Because it only optimizes the hardest triplet for each anchor image within the mini-batch, samples in the hardest triplet may all belong to the same modality, which will lead to the imbalance problem of modality optimization. To address this problem, we adopt the batch all triplet selection strategy, which selects all the possible triplets among samples to optimize instead of the hardest triplet. Furthermore, we introduce Unified Batch All Triplet loss and Cosine Softmax loss to collaboratively optimize the cosine distance between image vectors. Similarly, we rewrite the Hetero Center Triplet loss, which is proposed for VI-ReID task, into a batch all form to improve model performance. Extensive experiments indicate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, which outperform state-of-the-art methods by a wide margin.",cs.CV,2021,human

We mainly consider the case of all-to-all dynamics where transitions are possible between any two spin configurations with uniform rates. We show that the cumulant generating function of the time-integral of a normally distributed quenched random function of configurations, i.e., the energy function of the random energy model (REM), has a phase transition in the large $N$ limit for trajectories of any time extent. We prove this by determining the exact limit of the scaled cumulant generating function. This is accomplished by connecting the dynamical problem to a spectral analysis of the all-to-all quantum REM. We also discuss finite $N$ corrections as observed in numerical simulations.",cond-mat.stat-mech,2022,human

We propose the microscopic theory for computing the spectrum of all dyons for all values of I, generalizing earlier results that exist only for the simplest case of I=1. Our derivation uses a combination of arguments from duality, 4d-5d lift, and a careful analysis of fermionic zero modes. The resulting degeneracy agrees with the black hole degeneracy for large charges and with the degeneracy of field-theory dyons for small charges. It naturally satisfies several physical requirements including integrality and duality invariance. As a byproduct, we also derive the microscopic (0,4) superconformal field theory relevant for computing the spectrum of five-dimensional Strominger-Vafa black holes in ALE backgrounds and count the resulting degeneracies.",hep-th,2008,human

Due to their complex, high-dimensional nature, jets can be explored holistically by neural networks in ways that are not possible manually. However, innovations in all areas of jet physics are proceeding in parallel. We show that specially constructed machine learning models trained for a specific jet classification task can improve the accuracy, precision, or speed of all other jet physics tasks. This is demonstrated by training on a particular multiclass generation and classification task and then using the learned representation for different generation and classification tasks, for datasets with a different (full) detector simulation, for jets from a different collision system (pp versus ep), for generative models, for likelihood ratio estimation, and for anomaly detection. We consider, our OmniLearn approach thus as a jet-physics foundation model. It is made publicly available for use in any area where state-of-the-art precision is required for analyses involving jets and their substructure.","hep-ph,hep-ex",2025,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16132v3,"Hidden variables, free choice, context-independence, and all that","This paper provides a systematic account of the hidden variable models (HVMs) formulated to describe systems of random variables with mutually exclusive contexts. Any such system can be described either by a model with free choice but generally context-dependent mapping of the hidden variables into observable ones, or by a model with context-independent mapping but generally compromised free choice. These two types of HVMs are equivalent, one can always be translated into another. They are also unfalsifiable, applicable to all possible systems. These facts, the equivalence and unfalsifiability, imply that freedom of choice and context-independent mapping are no assumptions at all, and they tell us nothing about freedom of choice or physical influences exerted by contexts as these notions would be understood in science and philosophy. The conjunction of these two notions, however, defines a falsifiable HVM that describes noncontextuality when applied to systems with no disturbance or to consistifications of arbitrary systems. This HVM is most adequately captured by the term ""context-irrelevance,"" meaning that no distribution in the model changes with context.","quant-ph,math.PR",2023,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03142v1,Not All Tokens Are Meant to Be Forgotten,"Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained on massive text corpora, exhibit remarkable human-level language understanding, reasoning, and decision-making abilities. However, they tend to memorize unwanted information, such as private or copyrighted content, raising significant privacy and legal concerns. Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution, but existing methods face a significant challenge of over-forgetting. This issue arises because they indiscriminately suppress the generation of all the tokens in forget samples, leading to a substantial loss of model utility. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Targeted Information Forgetting (TIF) framework, which consists of (1) a flexible targeted information identifier designed to differentiate between unwanted words (UW) and general words (GW) in the forget samples, and (2) a novel Targeted Preference Optimization approach that leverages Logit Preference Loss to unlearn unwanted information associated with UW and Preservation Loss to retain general information in GW, effectively improving the unlearning process while mitigating utility degradation. Extensive experiments on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed TIF framework enhances unlearning effectiveness while preserving model utility and achieving state-of-the-art results.",cs.LG,2025,human

The spectra show a nearly flat band with pinch-point-like momentum dependence, accompanied by dispersive branches that generate half-moon features across multiple Brillouin zones. These defining signatures are captured quantitatively by a minimal dipolar-octupolar spin Hamiltonian, demonstrating excellent agreement between experiment and theory. The higher flat-mode energy helps account for the absence of dynamical interference in prior $\mathrm{μSR}$ studies, while the lack of any photon-like excitation imposes strict constraints on the proposed Coulombic antiferromagnet scenario.

Different from traditional RGB-based methods, this paper presents a new multi-focus image fusion method assisted by depth sensing. In this work, a depth sensor is used together with a color camera to capture images of a scene. A graph-based segmentation algorithm is used to segment the depth map from the depth sensor, and the segmented regions are used to guide a focus algorithm to locate in-focus image blocks from among multi-focus source images to construct the reference all-in-focus image. Five test scenes and six evaluation metrics were used to compare the proposed method and representative state-of-the-art algorithms.

However, only recently it has been pointed out that beams of light, under certain conditions, may exhibit a transverse spin angular momentum perpendicular to the propagation direction. When this happens, the electric field transported by the light rotates around an axis transverse to the beam path. Such kind of fields, although deceptively elusive, are almost ubiquitous in optics as they manifests in strongly focused beams, plasmonic fields and evanescent waves. In this work we present a general formalism describing all these phenomena. In particular, we demonstrate how to mathematically generate a wave field possessing transverse spin angular momentum density, from any arbitrarily given scalar wave field, either propagating and evanescent.","physics.optics,quant-ph",2015,human

The key concept in our work is the construction of a fully-balanced grammar $\mathcal{G}$ from $\mathcal{T}$ that meets a property that we call \emph{fix-free}: the expansions of the nonterminals that have the same height in the parse tree form a fix-free set (i.e., prefix-free and suffix-free). The fix-free property allows us to compute the MEMs of $\mathcal{T}$ incrementally over $\mathcal{G}$ using a standard suffix-tree-based MEM algorithm, which runs on a subset of grammar rules at a time and does not decompress nonterminals. By modifying the locally-consistent grammar of Christiansen et al 2020., we show how we can build $\mathcal{G}$ from $\mathcal{T}$ in linear time and space. We also demonstrate that our MEM algorithm runs on top of $\mathcal{G}$ in $O(G +occ)$ time and uses $O(\log G(G+occ))$ bits, where $G$ is the grammar size, and $occ$ is the number of MEMs in $\mathcal{T}$. In the conclusions, we discuss how our idea can be modified to implement approximate pattern matching in compressed space.","cs.IR,cs.DS",2023,human

This latter result, however, relies on a number of strong assumptions and guarantees a polynomial factor on the size of the large network compared to the target function. In this work, we remove the most limiting assumptions of this previous work while providing significantly tighter bounds:the overparameterized network only needs a logarithmic factor (in all variables but depth) number of neurons per weight of the target subnetwork.","cs.LG,stat.ML",2020,human

It has been suggested that finding an MIS is equivalent to computing a maximum matching of the network, where the unmatched nodes constitute an MIS. However, maximum matching of a network is often not unique, and finding all MISs may provide deep insights to the controllability of the network. Finding all possible input nodes, which form the union of all MISs, is computationally challenging for large networks. Here we present an efficient enumerative algorithm for the problem. The main idea is to modify a maximum matching algorithm to make it efficient for finding all possible input nodes by computing only one MIS. We rigorously proved the correctness of the new algorithm and evaluated its performance on synthetic and large real networks. The experimental results showed that the new algorithm ran several orders of magnitude faster than the existing method on large real networks.","cs.DM,cs.SI,physics.soc-ph",2017,human

In this paper, we use twistor string theory to describe the maximal helicity violating (MHV) sector of tree-level, four-dimensional gluon scattering as an effective 2d conformal field theory on the celestial sphere. By organizing the OPE between vertex operators in this theory in terms of soft gluon descendants, we obtain all-order expressions for the celestial OPE which include all regular contributions in the collinear expansion. This gives new, all-order formulae for the collinear splitting function (in momentum space) and celestial OPE coefficients (in the conformal primary basis) of tree-level MHV gluon scattering.

One of the main open problems in the theory of disc functionals is whether the Poisson envelope is plurisubharmonic on an arbitrary manifold.

We prove that the Jensen envelope is plurisubharmonic, with no assumptions on the manifold X. Hence $Jφ$ is the largest plurisubharmonic function smaller than $φ$.

The original proposal consisted of a massless first generation of quarks and no mixing with the third generation. In our case, through the addition of a third Higgs doublet with a small vacuum-expectation-value but very large masses, thus later decoupling, all quarks become massive and quark mixing is fully reproduced. In fact, all quark mixing angles are expressed in terms of $\tan β$ and one recovers trivial mixing in the limit $β\rightarrow 0$.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13984v1,One Jump Is All You Need: Short-Cutting Transformers for Early Exit Prediction with One Jump to Fit All Exit Levels,"To reduce the time and computational costs of inference of large language models, there has been interest in parameter-efficient low-rank early-exit casting of transformer hidden-representations to final-representations. Such low-rank short-cutting has been shown to outperform identity shortcuts at early model stages while offering parameter-efficiency in shortcut jumps. However, current low-rank methods maintain a separate early-exit shortcut jump to final-representations for each transformer intermediate block-level during inference. In this work, we propose selection of a single One-Jump-Fits-All (OJFA) low-rank shortcut that offers over a 30x reduction in shortcut parameter costs during inference. We show that despite this extreme reduction, our OJFA choice largely matches the performance of maintaining multiple shortcut jumps during inference and offers stable precision from all transformer block-levels for GPT2-XL, Phi3-Mini and Llama2-7B transformer models.","cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CL",2025,human

At first, one considers the process of the core modes formation as a result of excitation of continuous mode spectrum of single dielectric rod of the cladding. It is shown that the core modes can be considered as transverse resonance of a set of the radiation modes decoupled from the continuum provided that the phase matching condition for the propagation constants are fulfilled. An analogy between the core mode formation in all solid PBG fibers and formation of bound states in the continuum in photonics are drawn. Based on these conclusions, the light guiding in all solid PBG fiber with disordered cladding structure and quasi 3D photonic band gap formation in all solid PBG fibers with a small index (1%) can be explained.",physics.optics,2012,human

This problem is formulated as mutual training of skills using an intrinsic reward and a discriminator trained to predict a skill given its trajectory. Our initial solution replaces the standard one-vs-all (softmax) discriminator with a one-vs-one (all pairs) discriminator and combines it with a novel intrinsic reward function and a dropout regularization technique. The combined approach is named APART: Diverse Skill Discovery using All Pairs with Ascending Reward and Dropout. We demonstrate that APART discovers all the possible skills in grid worlds with remarkably fewer samples than previous works. Motivated by the empirical success of APART, we further investigate an even simpler algorithm that achieves maximum skills by altering VIC, rescaling its intrinsic reward, and tuning the temperature of its softmax discriminator. We believe our findings shed light on the crucial factors underlying success of skill discovery algorithms in reinforcement learning.","cs.LG,cs.AI",2023,human

In this work, we propose using discrete-state models to connect them and explore their scalability in the vision domain. First, we conduct a step-by-step analysis in a unified design space across two types of models including timestep-independence, noise schedule, temperature, guidance strength, etc in a scalable manner. Second, we re-cast typical discriminative tasks, e.g., image segmentation, as an unmasking process from [MASK] tokens on a discrete-state model. This enables us to perform various sampling processes, including flexible conditional sampling by only training once to model the joint distribution. All aforementioned explorations lead to our framework named Discrete Interpolants, which enables us to achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to previous discrete-state based methods in various benchmarks, like ImageNet256, MS COCO, and video dataset FaceForensics. In summary, by leveraging [MASK] in discrete-state models, we can bridge Masked Generative and Non-autoregressive Diffusion models, as well as generative and discriminative tasks.","cs.CV,cs.AI",2024,human

When two layers are stacked together to form a bilayer the interlayer exchange coupling can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic depending on the stacking sequence. Here we combine crystallographic arguments based on the close-packing condition with first-principles simulations to enumerate all possible stacking patterns in CrX$_3$ bilayers that preserve the spatial periodicity of each layer. We recover all configurations observed in bulk crystals and disclose stacking sequences with no bulk counterpart where the two layers have opposite chirality. Stacking sequences are ranked according to their relative stability and a preferential interlayer magnetic ordering is assigned to each of them.

Each specimen has probability $p$ of being contaminated (e.g., in the case of an infectious disease, $p$ is the prevalence rate), independently of the other specimens. In many cases group testing is applicable, namely one can take small portions from several specimens, mix them together and test the mixture for contamination, so that if the test turns positive, then at least one of the samples in the mixture is contaminated.   In this paper we give a detailed probabilistic analysis of a binary search scheme, we propose, for determining all contaminated specimens. More precisely, we study the number $T(N)$ of tests required in order to find all the contaminated specimens, if this search scheme is applied. We derive recursive and, in some cases, explicit formulas for the expectation, the variance, and the characteristic function of $T(N)$. Also, we determine the asymptotic behavior of the moments of $T(N)$ as $N \to \infty$ and from that we obtain the limiting distribution of $T(N)$ (appropriately normalized), which turns out to be normal.",math.PR,2020,human

Namely, we show that any maximum stable set of such a tree contains at least one pendant vertex. Moreover, we prove that if T does not own a perfect matching, then a stable set, consisting of at least two pendant vertices, is included in the intersection of all its maximum stable sets.

This approach requires iterative solutions of the linearized coupled-cluster equations leading to convergence issues in some cases where correlation corrections are particularly large or lead to an oscillating pattern. Moreover, these issues also lead to similar problems in the CI+all-order method for many-particle systems.

We compare the resulting couplings for zero velocity and gauge field strength, with the $α'^2$ terms of the disk-level S-matrix element of two massless NSNS vertex operators in the presence of a constant background B-field. We have found an exact agreement.",hep-th,2016,human

It states that outside of special cases, one cannot exactly and simultaneously satisfy all three common and intuitive definitions of fairness - demographic parity, equalized odds, and predictive rate parity. This result has driven most works to focus on solutions for one or two of the metrics. Rather than follow suit, in this paper we present a framework that pushes the limits of the impossibility theorem in order to satisfy all three metrics to the best extent possible. We develop an integer-programming based approach that can yield a certifiably optimal post-processing method for simultaneously satisfying multiple fairness criteria under small violations. We show experiments demonstrating that our post-processor can improve fairness across the different definitions simultaneously with minimal model performance reduction. We also discuss applications of our framework for model selection and fairness explainability, thereby attempting to answer the question: who's the fairest of them all?","cs.CY,cs.AI,cs.LG,stat.AP",2022,human

While SCS is NP-hard and MAX-SNP-hard, the Greedy Algorithm ""choose two strings with the largest overlap; merge them; repeat"" achieves a constant factor approximation that is known to be at most 3.5 and conjectured to be equal to 2. The Greedy Algorithm is not deterministic, so its instantiations with different tie-breaking rules may have different approximation factors. In this paper, we show that it is not the case: all factors are equal. To prove this, we show how to transform a set of strings so that all overlaps are different whereas their ratios stay roughly the same.   We also reveal connections between the original version of SCS and the following one: find a~superstring minimizing the number of occurrences of a given symbol. It turns out that the latter problem is equivalent to the original one.",cs.DS,2021,human

Despite the best efforts of networking researchers and practitioners, an ideal Internet experience is inaccessible to an overwhelming majority of people the world over, mainly due to the lack of cost efficient ways of provisioning high-performance global Internet. In this paper, we argue that instead of an exclusive focus on a utopian goal of universally accessible ""ideal networking"" (in which we have high throughput and quality of service as well as low latency and congestion), we should consider providing ""approximate networking"" through the adoption of context-appropriate tradeoffs.

Moreover, all the errors from different optical neurons here are independent, thus the AONN could scale up to a larger system size with final error still maintaining in a similar level of a single neuron. We confirm its capability and feasibility in machine learning by successfully classifying the order and disorder phases of a typical statistic Ising model.

In the large-Nc limit, all infrared and collinear divergences are determined by just three functions; one of them, the cusp anomalous dimension, plays a key role also for non-planar contributions. Indeed, all infrared and collinear divergences of massless gauge theory amplitudes with any number of hard partons may be captured by a surprisingly simple expression constructed as a sum over color dipoles. Potential corrections to this expression, correlating four or more hard partons at three loops or beyond, are tightly constrained and are currently under study.",hep-ph,2010,human

No violation of this geometrical fact can be produced by spontaneous breaking of the Lorentz symmetry, even if the field-theoretical framework is enlarged so as to include short-distance singularities wilder than distributions.","hep-th,math-ph",2002,human

We aim to overcome two facts: 1) simulation is not identification, 2) the ASMs simulating machines of some type do not constitute a natural class among all ASMs. We modify Gurevich's notion of ASM to that of EMA (""Evolving MultiAlgebra"") by replacing the program (which is a syntactic object) by a semantic object: a functional which has to be very simply definable over the static part of the ASM. We prove that very natural classes of EMAs correspond via ""literal identifications"" to slight extensions of the usual machine models and also to grammar models. Though we modify these models, we keep their computation approach: only some contingencies are modified. Thus, EMAs appear as the mathematical model unifying all kinds of sequential computation paradigms.","cs.FL,cs.LO",2010,human

We propose an interactive, scribble-based annotation framework which operates on the whole image to produce segmentations for all regions. This enables sharing scribble corrections across regions, and allows the annotator to focus on the largest errors made by the machine across the whole image. To realize this, we adapt Mask-RCNN into a fast interactive segmentation framework and introduce an instance-aware loss measured at the pixel-level in the full image canvas, which lets predictions for nearby regions properly compete for space. Finally, we compare to interactive single object segmentation on the COCO panoptic dataset. We demonstrate that our interactive full image segmentation approach leads to a 5% IoU gain, reaching 90% IoU at a budget of four extreme clicks and four corrective scribbles per region.",cs.CV,2018,human

We prove that almost all cancellative triple systems with vertex set [n] are tripartite. This sharpens a theorem of Nagle and Rodl on the number of cancellative triple systems.

An important task when working with sets of networks is network comparison, developing a similarity or distance measure between networks so that meaningful comparisons can be drawn. The best means to accomplish this task remains an open area of research. Here we introduce a new measure to compare networks, the Network Portrait Divergence, that is mathematically principled, incorporates the topological characteristics of networks at all structural scales, and is general-purpose and applicable to all types of networks. An important feature of our measure that enables many of its useful properties is that it is based on a graph invariant, the network portrait. We test our measure on both synthetic graphs and real world networks taken from protein interaction data, neuroscience, and computational social science applications.

However, if the graph does not contain any negative weighted edge, using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for every vertex as a source vertex to produce all pairs shortest paths of the graph works much better than the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for sparse graphs. Also, for the graphs with negative weighted edges, with no negative cycle, Johnson's algorithm still performs significantly better than the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for sparse graphs. Johnson's algorithm transforms the graph into a non-negative one by using the Bellman-Ford algorithm, then, applies the Dijkstra's algorithm. Thus, in general the Floyd-Warshall algorithm becomes very inefficient especially for sparse graphs. In this paper, we show a simple improvement on the Floyd-Warshall algorithm that will increases its performance especially for the sparse graphs, so it can be used instead of more complicated alternatives.",cs.DS,2021,human

The lately proposed deformable butterfly (DeBut) decomposes the filter matrix into generalized, butterflylike factors, thus achieving network compression orthogonal to the traditional ways of pruning or low-rank decomposition. This work reveals an intimate link between DeBut and a systematic hierarchy of depthwise and pointwise convolutions, which explains the empirically good performance of DeBut layers. By developing an automated DeBut chain generator, we show for the first time the viability of homogenizing a DNN into all DeBut layers, thus achieving an extreme sparsity and compression. Various examples and hardware benchmarks verify the advantages of All-DeBut networks. In particular, we show it is possible to compress a PointNet to < 5% parameters with < 5% accuracy drop, a record not achievable by other compression schemes.",cs.LG,2023,human

With the gauge reduction with respect to edge-simplicity constraint being proceeded and the anomalous vertex simplicity constraint being imposed weakly in holonomy-flux phase space, the simplicity reduced holonomy can be established. However, we find that the simplicity reduced holonomy can not capture the degrees of freedom of intrinsic curvature, which leads that it fails to construct a correct scalar constraint operator in all dimensional LQG following the standard strategy. To tackle this problem, we establish a new type of holonomy corresponding to the simplicity reduced connection, which captures the degrees of freedom of both intrinsic and extrinsic curvature properly. Based on this new type of holonomy, we propose three new strategies to construct the scalar constraint operators, which serve as valuable candidates to study the dynamics of all dimensional LQG in the future.",gr-qc,2022,human

However, this frequency power expansion is found to diverge at the first band gap edge. Thus, an alternative set of effective parameters, made of the propagation index and the surface impedance, is proposed. It is established that these effective parameters, as functions of the complex frequency, possess all the analytic properties required by the causality principle and passivity.

In view of the fact that this problem is undecidable, it is natural to ask whether known well-behaved classes of TGDs ensure decidability. We consider here the main paradigms that led to robust TGD-based formalisms, that is, guardedness and stickiness. Although all-instances termination is well-understood for the oblivious version of the chase, the more subtle case of the restricted (a.k.a. the standard) chase is rather unexplored.

Multi-domain learning looks at ways to learn a multitude of different tasks, each coming from a different domain, at once. The most common approach in multi-domain learning is to form a domain agnostic model, the parameters of which are shared among all domains, and learn a small number of extra domain-specific parameters for each individual new domain. However, different domains come with different levels of difficulty; parameterizing the models of all domains using an augmented version of the domain agnostic model leads to unnecessarily inefficient solutions, especially for easy to solve tasks. We propose an adaptive parameterization approach to deep neural networks for multi-domain learning.

In this paper, we systematically study optimization of a smooth function $f\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ only assuming an oracle that compares function values at two points and tells which is larger. When $f$ is convex, we give two algorithms using $\tilde{O}(n/ε)$ and $\tilde{O}(n^{2})$ comparison queries to find an $ε$-optimal solution, respectively. When $f$ is nonconvex, our algorithm uses $\tilde{O}(n/ε^2)$ comparison queries to find an $ε$-approximate stationary point. All these results match the best-known zeroth-order algorithms with function evaluation queries in $n$ dependence, thus suggest that \emph{comparisons are all you need for optimizing smooth functions using derivative-free methods}. In addition, we also give an algorithm for escaping saddle points and reaching an $ε$-second order stationary point of a nonconvex $f$, using $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5}/ε^{2.5})$ comparison queries.","cs.LG,cs.DS,math.OC",2024,human

One major set of tools for studying infinitesimal rigidity happens to be throughout the (negative) Hessian $M_T$ of the discrete Hilbert-Einstein functional. Besides its theoretical importance, it provides the necessary machinery to tackle the problem experimentally. To search for potential counterexamples to the conjecture, one constructs an explicit family of so-called $T$-polyhedra, all of which are weakly convex and decomposable, while being non-codecomposable. Since infinitesimal rigidity is equivalent to a non-degenerate $M_T$, one can let Mathematica search for the eigenvalues of $M_T$ and gather experimental evidence that such a flexible, weakly convex and decomposable $T$-polyhedron may not exist.","math.DG,math.MG",2023,human

Our formalism is based on the exact analytical Dirac-Coulomb Green's function and, therefore, accounts for the interaction of the virtual electron-positron pair with the nucleus to all orders, including the Coulomb corrections. The numerical convergence of our calculations is accelerated by solving the radial integrals that are involved analytically in the asymptotic region. Numerical results for the collision of photons with energies 102.2 keV and 255.5 keV with bare neon and lead nuclei are compared with the predictions of the lowest-order Born approximation. We find that our method can produce accurate results within a reasonable computation time and that the Coulomb corrections enhance the absolute value of the Delbrück amplitude by a few percent for the studied photon energies.",hep-th,2022,human

http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.1840v2,All reversible dynamics in maximally non-local theories are trivial,"A remarkable feature of quantum theory is non-locality (i.e. the presence of correlations which violate Bell inequalities). However, quantum correlations are not maximally non-local, and it is natural to ask whether there are compelling reasons for rejecting theories in which stronger violations are possible. To shed light on this question, we consider post-quantum theories in which maximally non-local states (non-local boxes) occur. It has previously been conjectured that the set of dynamical transformations possible in such theories is severely limited. We settle the question affirmatively in the case of reversible dynamics, by completely characterizing all such transformations allowed in this setting. We find that the dynamical group is trivial, in the sense that it is generated solely by local operations and permutations of systems. In particular, no correlations can ever be created; non-local boxes cannot be prepared from product states (in other words, no analogues of entangling unitary operations exist), and classical computers can efficiently simulate all such processes.",quant-ph,2009,human

However, most of the studied attacks employ a single type of trigger. Consequently, proposed backdoor defenders often rely on the assumption that triggers would appear in a unified way. In this paper, we show that this naive assumption can create a loophole, allowing more sophisticated backdoor attacks to bypass. We design a novel backdoor attack mechanism that incorporates multiple types of backdoor triggers, focusing on stealthiness and effectiveness. Our journey begins with the intriguing observation that the performance of a backdoor attack in deep learning models, as well as its detectability and removability, are all proportional to the magnitude of the trigger. Based on this correlation, we propose reducing the magnitude of each trigger type and combining them to achieve a strong backdoor relying on the combined trigger while still staying safely under the radar of defenders. Extensive experiments on three standard datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve high attack success rates (ASRs) while consistently bypassing state-of-the-art defenses.","cs.CR,cs.CV",2025,human

We consider the task of GHZ encoding using all-to-all interactions, which prepares the GHZ state in a special case, and is furthermore useful for quantum error correction, interaction-rate enhancement, and transmitting information using power-law interactions. The naive protocol based on parallelizing CNOT gates takes $\mathrm{O}(1)$-time of Hamiltonian evolution. In this work, we propose a fast protocol that achieves GHZ encoding with high accuracy. The evolution time $\mathrm{O}(\log^2N/N)$ almost saturates the theoretical limit $Ω(\log N/N)$. Moreover, the final state is close to the ideal encoded one with high fidelity $> 1-10^{-3}$, up to large system sizes $N\lesssim 2000$. The protocol only requires a few stages of time-independent Hamiltonian evolution; the key idea is to use the data qubit as control, and to use fast spin-squeezing dynamics generated by e.g. two-axis-twisting.",quant-ph,2024,human

Here we demonstrate such a metasurface for an advanced THz control of spins in a ferrimagnetic film of iron garnet. Structuring a nonmagnetic substrate one can force a THz electromagnetic field, otherwise described by plane waves, to acquire an out-of-plane magnetic field and thus enable arbitrary direction of the torque acting on spins in all three dimensions.

The usual set consists of single qubit rotations and a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, which flips the state of a target qubit conditional on the control qubit being in the state 1. Here we report an unambiguous experimental demonstration and comprehensive characterization of quantum CNOT operation in an optical system. We produce all four entangled Bell states as a function of only the input qubits' logical values, for a single operating condition of the gate.

Correlation functions in this state may be computed on the Euclidean section and Wick-rotated to Lorentz-signature. The results are manifestly de Sitter-invariant and contain only the familiar UV singularities. More importantly, the connected parts of all Lorentz-signature correlators decay at large separations of their arguments. Our results apply to all cases in which the free Euclidean vacuum is well defined, including scalars with masses belonging to both the complementary and principal series of $SO(D,1)$. This suggests that interacting QFTs in de Sitter -- including higher spin fields -- are perturbatively IR-stable at least when i) the Euclidean vacuum of the zero-coupling theory exists and ii) corresponding Lorentz-signature zero-coupling correlators decay at large separations.

As an organism evolves and follows a path of proximate causation, if the vector is closely parallel to that of the ultimate causation then the changes will confer desirable attributes which will lead to further development. If however the variations do not occur in a direction close to the of the ultimate causation vector the evolved organism will quickly die out. This may be viewed as similar to Feynmans sum over all histories. Therefore, the principle of least action gives a direction, but not a purpose, to evolution. Taking the coevolution model of Lewontin, an equation of motion for coevolution shows that it is the rate of evolutionary change that responds to changes in the environment, in line with some evidence.

We image in real time and simultaneously the lattice parameter and crystal orientation of the dense LiCoO2 cathode, the Ti current collector and the electrodeposited Li metal anode. We reveal that reaction mechanism of LiCoO2 depends on the crystal orientation, and that, in dense electrodes as opposed to porous ones, the delithiation is limited by the formation of a Li-rich insulating interface. Li metal crystal orientation is found to be influenced initially by the Ti texture and to change within minutes during plating and stripping.

Our theorem is for piecewise linear minimal valid functions that have only rational breakpoints (in $1/q\,\mathbb{Z}$ for some $q\in \mathbb{N}$) and that take rational values at the breakpoints. In contrast to Basu et al.'s construction, our construction preserves all function values on $1/q\,\mathbb{Z}$. As a corollary, we obtain that every extreme function for the finite group problem on $1/q\,\mathbb{Z}$ is the restriction of a continuous piecewise linear two-slope extreme function for the infinite group problem with breakpoints on a refinement $1/(Mq)\,\mathbb{Z}$ for some $M\in \mathbb{N}$. In combination with Gomory's master theorem [Some Polyhedra related to Combinatorial Problems, Lin. Alg.

This approach requires the development of new tools to rapidly characterize these materials libraries and new techniques to analyze the resulting data. The research presented here is intended to make a contribution towards meeting this demand, and thereby advance the pace of materials research. In many cases photovoltaic determinations are well-suited for high throughput methodologies, enabling direct quantitative analysis of properties whose implementation I demonstrate my thesis. This thesis focuses on the development and utilization of high throughput and combinatorial methods that have incorporated, or are associated with, the all-oxide photovoltaic field. The development of new absorbers often requires novel buffer layers, contact materials, and interface engineering.

Such a certification is device-independent (DI), i.e., one makes no assumption neither on the underlying state nor on the measurements. However, not all steerable states can violate a Bell inequality. Here, we systematically construct a collection of witnesses for steerable resources, defined by assemblages, in a measurement-device-independent (MDI) scenario. The inputs driving the measurement are replaced by a set of tomographically complete quantum states, and neither the detectors nor the underlying state is characterized. We show that all steerable assemblages can be detected by properly chosen witnesses. Furthermore, we introduce the first measure of steerability in an MDI scenario and show that such a measure is a standard one, i.e., a steering monotone, by proving that it is equivalent to the steering robustness.",quant-ph,2018,human

Quantum analogues of Raz's classical parallel repetition theorem have been proved for many special classes of games. However, for general entangled games no parallel repetition theorem was known. We prove that the entangled value of a two-player game $G$ repeated $n$ times in parallel is at most $c_G n^{-1/4} \log n$ for a constant $c_G$ depending on $G$, provided that the entangled value of $G$ is less than 1. In particular, this gives the first proof that the entangled value of a parallel repeated game must converge to 0 for all games whose entangled value is less than 1. Central to our proof is a combination of both classical and quantum correlated sampling.","quant-ph,cs.CC",2016,human

To obtain complete information for a making better decisions, a multi-terminal network reliability extends the two specific nodes to a specific node subset in which all nodes are connected.

Learning a policy to navigate between all pairs of states individually is often not feasible. An all-goals updating algorithm uses each transition to learn Q-values towards all goals simultaneously and off-policy. However the expensive numerous updates in parallel limited the approach to small tabular cases so far. To tackle this problem we propose to use convolutional network architectures to generate Q-values and updates for a large number of goals at once. We demonstrate the accuracy and generalization qualities of the proposed method on randomly generated mazes and Sokoban puzzles. In the case of on-screen goal coordinates the resulting mapping from frames to distance-maps directly informs the agent about which places are reachable and in how many steps. As an example of application we show that replacing the random actions in epsilon-greedy exploration by several actions towards feasible goals generates better exploratory trajectories on Montezuma's Revenge and Super Mario All-Stars games.,"cs.LG,stat.ML",2018,human

Multisite phosphorylation, the addition of phosphate groups to multiple sites of a single molecule, may be distributive or processive. Distributive systems can be bistable, while processive systems were recently shown to be globally stable. However, this global convergence result was proven only for a specific mechanism of processive phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (namely, all catalytic reactions are reversible). Accordingly, we generalize this result to allow for processive phosphorylation networks in which each reaction may be irreversible, and also to account for possible product inhibition. We accomplish this by defining an all-encompassing processive network that encapsulates all of these schemes, and then appealing to recent results of Marcondes de Freitas, Wiuf, and Feliu that assert global convergence by way of monontone systems theory and network/graph reductions (which correspond to removal of intermediate complexes).

Since the monoids under consideration are endomorphism monoids of relational structures definable in the random graph, we are able to draw several model-theoretic corollaries: One consequence of our result is that all structures with a first-order definition in the random graph are model-complete. Moreover, we obtain a classification of these structures up to existential interdefinability.","math.LO,math.CO",2009,human

Yin have developed a Ricci flow existence theory that gives a complete Ricci flow starting with a surface equipped with a conformal structure and a nonatomic Radon measure as a volume measure. This led to the discovery of a large array of new expanding Ricci solitons. In this paper we use the recent uniqueness theory in this context, also developed by the second author and H. Yin, to give a complete classification of all expanding Ricci solitons on surfaces. Along the way, we prove a converse to the existence theory that is not constrained to solitons: every complete Ricci flow on a surface over a time interval $(0,\varepsilon)$ admits a $t\downarrow 0$ limit within the class of admissible initial data. This makes surfaces the first nontrivial setting for Ricci flow in which a bijection can be given between the entire set of complete Ricci flows over maximal time intervals $(0,T)$, and a class of initial data that induces them.",math.DG,2023,human

Analysing the proof we see: The fact that for definite signature flatness can be characterized by the vanishing of a curvature invariant, essentially rests on the compactness of the rotation group $SO(n)$. For Lorentz signature, however, one has the non-compact Lorentz group $SO(3,1)$ instead of it. A further and independent proof of the corollary uses the fact, that the Geroch limit does not lead to a Hausdorff topology, so a sequence of gravitational waves can converge to the flat space-time, even if each element of the sequence is the same pp-wave.",gr-qc,1994,human

For very high energy (E_e+, E_e- > 3 GeV) forward pairs at LHC the reduction from perturbation theory is a bit larger (17%). Use of zero degree calorimeter triggering (and thus small impact parameter weighting) makes impact parameter representation of exact pair production useful.

However, multi-particle single and mixed harmonics cumulants can not be described by hydrodynamics with these three initial conditions, even for the signs in a few cases. Further studies show that the non-linear response plays an important role in the hydrodynamic expansion of the p--p systems. Such an effect can change $c_2\{4\}$ from a negative value in the initial state to a positive value in the final state. The failure of the hydrodynamic description of multi-particle cumulant triggers the questions on whether the hydrodynamics can rule all collision systems, including p--p collisions at the LHC.","nucl-th,nucl-ex",2020,human

Due to the double logarithmic nature of the quantum evolution of the saturation momentum, its large $L$ asymptotics is obtained by slightly departing from the double logarithmic limit of either next-to-leading log (NLL) BFKL or leading order DGLAP evolution equations. At fixed coupling, or in conformal $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory, we derive the large $L$ expansion of $Q_s(L)$ up to order $α_s^{3/2}$. In QCD with massless quarks, where conformal symmetry is broken by the running of the strong coupling constant, the one-loop QCD $β$-function fully accounts for the universal terms in the $Q_s(L)$ expansion. Therefore, the universal coefficients of this series are known exactly to all orders in $α_s$.","hep-ph,hep-th,nucl-th",2022,human

The radiation efficiency declines steeply below that critical rate. This leads to a clear dichotomy between AGN and normal galaxies which is not so much given by differences in the mass flow rate but by the radiation efficiency.

A common way to enhance generalization is self-supervised pre-training on large datasets. However, aiming to perform well on all possible proteins can limit a model's capacity to excel on any specific one, whereas experimentalists typically need accurate predictions for individual proteins they study, often not covered in training data. To address this limitation, we propose a method that enables self-supervised customization of protein language models to one target protein at a time, on the fly, and without assuming any additional data. We show that our Protein Test-Time Training (ProteinTTT) method consistently enhances generalization across different models, their sizes, and datasets. ProteinTTT improves structure prediction for challenging targets, achieves new state-of-the-art results on protein fitness prediction, and enhances function prediction on two tasks. Through two challenging case studies, we also show that customization via ProteinTTT achieves more accurate antibody-antigen loop modeling and enhances 19% of structures in the Big Fantastic Virus Database, delivering improved predictions where general-purpose AlphaFold2 and ESMFold struggle.","cs.LG,q-bio.BM",2024,human

Entanglement sudden death (ESD) is the phenomenon wherein disentanglement happens in finite time even when individual qubits decohere only asymptotically in time due to noise. Prolonging the entanglement is essential for the practical realization of entanglement-based quantum information and computation protocols. For this purpose, the local NOT operation in the computational basis on one or both qubits has been proposed.

We derive the low-energy effective lagrangian which turns out to involve two parameters, one measuring the non-minimal coupling of fermions in the presence of torsion, the other being the Immirzi parameter. In the case of non-minimal coupling the effective lagrangian contains an axial-vector interaction leading to parity violation. Alternatively, in the case of minimal coupling there is no parity violation and the effective lagrangian contains only the usual axial-axial interaction. In this situation the real values of the Immirzi parameter are not at all constrained. On the other hand, purely imaginary values of the Immirzi parameter lead to violations of unitarity for the case of non-minimal coupling. Finally, the effective lagrangian blows up for the positive and negative unit imaginary values of the Immirzi parameter.","hep-th,gr-qc,hep-ph",2005,human

The divergence-free condition on the velocity in the incompressible regime is respected, and an the pressure is computed via an elliptic equation resulting from a suitable combination of the momentum and energy equations. The implicit treatment of the acoustic part allows the time-step to be independent of the Mach number. The scheme is conservative and applies to steady or unsteady flows and to general equations of state. One and Two-dimensional numerical results provide a validation of the Asymptotic-Preserving 'all-speed' properties.",math-ph,2011,human

Such codes have a well-known interpretation as quantum codes and correspond to isotropic systems. It has also been shown that these codes can be represented as graphs, and that two codes are equivalent if and only if the corresponding graphs are equivalent with respect to local complementation and graph isomorphism. We use these facts to classify all codes of length up to 12, where previously only all codes of length up to 9 were known. We also classify all extremal Type II codes of length 14. Finally, we find that the smallest Type I and Type II codes with trivial automorphism group have length 9 and 12, respectively.","math.CO,cs.IT",2005,human

In particular, the convex weight of any quantum resource corresponds exactly to the relative advantage it offers in an exclusion task.

Interestingly, we find that the expressiveness of WL is sufficient to identify almost all graphs in most datasets. Moreover, we find that the classification accuracy upper bounds are often close to 100\%.

The spreading power of all network nodes is better explained by considering, from a continuous-time epidemiological perspective, the distribution of the force of infection each node generates. The resulting metric, the \textit{expected force}, accurately quantifies node spreading power under all primary epidemiological models across a wide range of archetypical human contact networks. When node power is low, influence is a function of neighbor degree. As power increases, a node's own degree becomes more important. The strength of this relationship is modulated by network structure, being more pronounced in narrow, dense networks typical of social networking and weakening in broader, looser association networks such as the Internet. The expected force can be computed independently for individual nodes, making it applicable for networks whose adjacency matrix is dynamic, not well specified, or overwhelmingly large.","cs.SI,cs.CY,physics.soc-ph",2014,human

We use this result to show that for 5 or more qubits, the action of deterministic local operations and classical communication (LOCC) can almost always be simulated simply by local unitary (LU) operations. This proves that almost all n-qubit states with n>4 are isolated, that is they can neither be reached nor converted into any other (n-partite entangled), LU-inequivalent state via deterministic LOCC. We also find a simple and elegant expression for the maximal probability to convert one multi-qubit entangled state to another for this generic set of states.","quant-ph,math-ph",2016,human

Coron and Crépeau (2003) proved that the nonlinear system is small-time locally controllable even if the linearized system is not, provided that $k= l$ is the only solution pair. Later, Cerpa and Crepeau showed that the system is large-time locally controllable for all critical lengths. In 2020, Coron, Koenig, and Nguyen found that the system is not small-time locally controllable if $2k+l\not \in 3\mathbb{N}^*$.   We demonstrate that if the critical length satisfies $2k+l \in 3\mathbb{N}^*$ with $k\neq l$, then the system is not small-time locally controllable.

These synthetic tasks serve as independent auxiliary tasks. Our results show consistent and significant performance improvement across all 19 molecular property prediction tasks. For 16 out of 19 targets, the multitask Graph Transformer outperforms the XGBoost single-task learner. This demonstrates that synthetic task augmentation is an effective method for enhancing neural model performance in multitask molecular property prediction without the need for feature injection or pretraining.","cs.LG,cs.AI",2025,human

Complex latent cost functions from contextual features can be represented in the algorithm through a neural network approximation.

In a vertical heterostructure composed by two Dirac materials, the Dirac cones of the two materials survive the weak interlayer van der Waals interaction based on density functional theory method, and electron transport from the Dirac cone of one material to the one of the other material is therefore forbidden without assistance of phonon because of momentum mismatch. First-principles quantum transport simulations of the all-metallic vertical Dirac material heterostructure devices confirm the existence of a transport gap of over 0.4 eV, accompanied by a switching ratio of over 104. Such a striking behavior is robust against the relative rotation between the two Dirac materials and can be extended to twisted bilayer graphene. Therefore, all-metallic junction can be a semiconductor and novel avenue is opened up for Dirac material vertical structures in high-performance devices without opening their band gaps.","cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall",2014,human

Agents acting at high frequencies have the best control opportunities, along with some drawbacks, such as possible inefficient exploration and vanishing of the action advantages. The repetition of the actions, i.e., action persistence, comes into help, as it allows the agent to visit wider regions of the state space and improve the estimation of the action effects. In this work, we derive a novel All-Persistence Bellman Operator, which allows an effective use of both the low-persistence experience, by decomposition into sub-transition, and the high-persistence experience, thanks to the introduction of a suitable bootstrap procedure. In this way, we employ transitions collected at any time scale to update simultaneously the action values of the considered persistence set.

Indeed, our interpretations of the functioning of macroscopic thermodynamic cycles are so focused. Using a recently derived Second Law for information processing, we show that different subsets of fluctuations lead to distinct thermodynamic functioning in Maxwellian Demons. For example, while typical realizations may operate as an engine -- converting thermal fluctuations to useful work -- even ""nearby"" fluctuations (nontypical, but probable realizations) behave differently, as Landauer erasers -- converting available stored energy to dissipate stored information. One concludes that ascribing a single, unique functional modality to a thermodynamic system, especially one on the nanoscale, is at best misleading, likely masking an array of simultaneous, parallel thermodynamic transformations.

To reduce the running time of temporal closeness computations, we introduce an index to speed up SSAD temporal distance queries called Substream index. We show that deciding if a Substream index of a given size exists is NP-complete and provide an efficient greedy approximation. Moreover, we improve the running time of the approximation using min-hashing and parallelization. Our evaluation with real-world temporal networks shows a running time improvement of up to one order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art temporal closeness ranking algorithms.","cs.DB,cs.DS",2021,human

In network routing problems, if network traffic is composed of many individual agents, it is known that self-interested behavior among the agents can lead to suboptimal network congestion. We study situations in which a system planner charges monetary tolls for the use of network links in an effort to incentivize efficient routing choices by the users, but in which the users' sensitivity to tolls is heterogeneous and unknown. We seek locally-computed tolls that are guaranteed not to incentivize worse network routing than in the un-influenced case. Our main result is to show that if networks are sufficiently complex and populations sufficiently diverse, perverse incentives cannot be systematically avoided: any taxation mechanism that improves outcomes on one network must necessarily degrade them on another. Nonetheless, for the simple class of parallel networks, non-perverse taxes do exist; we fully characterize all such taxation mechanisms, showing that they are a generalized version of traditional marginal-cost tolls.","cs.GT,eess.SY,math.OC",2019,human

The informational completeness demands that matter fermions must appear in three families, each having 16 independent matter fermions. Meanwhile, the fermion family space is equipped with elementary SO(3) gauge fields in $\mathcal{M}_{9+1}$, giving rise to the Higgs mechanism in $\mathcal{M}_{3+1}$ through the gauge-Higgs unification. After quantum compactification of six extra dimensions, a trinity---the quantized gravity, the three-family fermions of total number 48, and their SO(6) and SO(3) gauge fields---naturally arises in an effective theory in $\mathcal{M}_{3+1}$.

Our main structural result asserts, roughly speaking, that such correlations asymptotically vanish for almost all $X$ if $g_1 \cdots g_k$ does not (weakly) pretend to be a twisted Dirichlet character $n \mapsto χ(n)n^{it}$, and behave asymptotically like a multiple of $d^{-it} χ(a)$ otherwise. This extends our earlier work on the structure of logarithmically averaged correlations, in which the $d$ parameter is averaged out and one can set $t=0$. Among other things, the result enables us to establish special cases of the Chowla and Elliott conjectures for (unweighted) averages at almost all scales; for instance, we establish the $k$-point Chowla conjecture $ \mathbb{E}_{n \leq X} λ(n+h_1) \cdots λ(n+h_k)=o(1)$ for $k$ odd or equal to $2$ for all scales $X$ outside of a set of zero logarithmic density.",math.NT,2018,human

The derivation is based on the nonrenormalization of the superpotential and the NSVZ equations. We argue that the scale invariance of the considered combinations takes place in the class of the HD+MSL schemes. This fact has been verified in the lowest orders, up to and including the one in which the dependence on the renormalization prescription becomes essential. It is also demonstrated that in the $\overline{\mbox{DR}}$ scheme the renormalization group invariance does not take place starting from the approximation, where the scheme dependence manifests itself.","hep-ph,hep-th",2024,human

http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10367v2,Parametric All-Optical Modulation on Chip,"We demonstrate parametric all-optical modulation in a periodically-poled lithium niobate microring resonator on chip. It employs quantum Zeno blockade between two distinct waves, a signal and a pump, through their sum-frequency generation at a large per-photon efficiency of 8.2 MHz. With nanosecond pump pulses at 6 mW peak power, 85.7% modulation extinction is observed, marking over 30~times efficiency improvement across various previous implementations. With only 2 mW pump peak power, 43.0% modulation extinction is observed for a doubly-stronger signal at 4 mW. This demonstrates, for the first time, that optical transistors with cascadability and fan-out are possible with just parametric nonlinear optics. These results, together with inherent advantages in such photonic integrated circuits, open the door to scalable technology for all-optical and quantum information processing.",physics.optics,2024,human

Because MVs are insensitive to the angular power spectrum $C_\ell$, our results are independent from the assumed cosmological model. We avoid a posteriori choices and use pre-defined ranges of scales $\ell\in[2,30]$, $\ell\in[2,600]$ and $\ell\in[2,1500]$ in our analyses. We find that all four masked Planck maps, from both 2015 and 2018 releases, are in agreement with statistical isotropy for $\ell\in[2,30]$, $\ell\in[2,600]$. For $\ell\in[2,1500]$ we detect anisotropies but this is indicative of simply the anisotropy in the noise: there is no anisotropy for $\ell < 1300$ and an increasing level of anisotropy at higher multipoles. Our findings of no large-scale anisotropies seem to be a consequence of avoiding \emph{a posteriori} statistics. We also find that the degree of anisotropy in the full sky (i.e. unmasked) maps vary enormously (between less than 5 and over 1000 standard deviations) among the different mapmaking procedures and data releases.","astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.IM,gr-qc",2018,human

They trace a path from a given source site to the destination site using electrical current, fluidic, growth of slime mould, Marangoni flow, crawling of epithelial cells, excitation waves in chemical medium, propagating crystallisation patterns. Some of the prototypes visualise the path using a stream of dye, thermal camera or glow discharge; others require a computer to extract the path from time lapse images of the tracing.

In order to handle reconverging paths more efficiently, we consider the case of double-vertex dominators which occur more frequently. First, we derive a number of specific properties of double-vertex dominators. Then, we describe a data structure for representing all double-vertex dominators of a given vertex in linear space.

Autoregressive TTS models typically use an attention mechanism to learn these alignments on-line. However, these alignments tend to be brittle and often fail to generalize to long utterances and out-of-domain text, leading to missing or repeating words. Most non-autoregressive endto-end TTS models rely on durations extracted from external sources. In this paper we leverage the alignment mechanism proposed in RAD-TTS as a generic alignment learning framework, easily applicable to a variety of neural TTS models. The framework combines forward-sum algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, and a simple and efficient static prior. In our experiments, the alignment learning framework improves all tested TTS architectures, both autoregressive (Flowtron, Tacotron 2) and non-autoregressive (FastPitch, FastSpeech 2, RAD-TTS). Specifically, it improves alignment convergence speed of existing attention-based mechanisms, simplifies the training pipeline, and makes the models more robust to errors on long utterances. Most importantly, the framework improves the perceived speech synthesis quality, as judged by human evaluators.","cs.SD,cs.CL,cs.LG,eess.AS",2021,human

Herein we investigate the spin dynamics and crystal field states of Nd2Hf2O7 using muon spin relaxation (muSR) and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. Our muSR study confirms the long range magnetic ordering and shows evidence for coexisting persistent dynamic spin fluctuations deep inside the ordered state down to 42 mK. The INS data show the crytal electric field (CEF) excitations due to the transitions both within the ground state multiplet and to the first excited state multiplet. The INS data are analyzed by a model based on CEF and crystal field states are determined. Strong Ising-type anisotropy is inferred from the ground state wavefunction.

This approach automatically includes the feature whereby probabilistic predictions are meaningful only in the context of a consistent set of history propositions. More strikingly, it leads to a picture in which the `truth values', or `semantic values' of such contextual predictions are not just two-valued (\ie true and false) but instead lie in a larger logical algebra---a Heyting algebra---whose structure is determined by the space $\B$ of Boolean subalgebras of $\UP$.","gr-qc,quant-ph",1996,human

These decoupling relations connect higher loop DCI integrals with the lower ones, enabling us to identify their coefficients starting from the 3-loop case. And surprisingly, the delicate mechanism of this process is the simple Mondrian rule D=X+Y, which forces those visually non-Mondrian DCI integrals to have the correct coefficients such that the amplituhedron can exactly reduce to the lower loop one.

When the Mach number tends to zero, the compressible Euler equation converges to its incompressible counterpart, in which the density becomes a constant. Increasing approximation errors and severe stability constraints are the main difficulty in the low Mach regime. The key idea of our all speed scheme is the special semi-implicit time discretization, in which the low Mach number stiff term is divided into two parts, one being treated explicitly and the other one implicitly. Moreover, the flux of the density equation is also treated implicitly and an elliptic type equation is derived to obtain the density. In this way, the correct limit can be captured without requesting the mesh size and time step to be smaller than the Mach number.

When the Mach number tends to zero, the compressible Euler equation converges to its incompressible counterpart, in which the density becomes a constant. Increasing approximation errors and severe stability constraints are the main difficulty in the low Mach regime. The key idea of our all speed scheme is the special semi-implicit time discretization, in which the low Mach number stiff term is divided into two parts, one being treated explicitly and the other one implicitly. Moreover, the flux of the density equation is also treated implicitly and an elliptic type equation is derived to obtain the density. In this way, the correct limit can be captured without requesting the mesh size and time step to be smaller than the Mach number. Compared with previous semi-implicit methods, nonphysical oscillations can be suppressed. We develop this semi-implicit time discretization in the framework of a first order local Lax-Friedrich (LLF) scheme and numerical tests are displayed to demonstrate its performances.",math-ph,2009,human

Our aim is to propose a well-balanced, all-regime and positive scheme. By well-balanced, it is meant that the scheme is able to preserve the so-called lake at rest smooth equilibrium solutions. By all-regime, we mean that the scheme is able to deal with all flow regimes, including the low-Froude regime which is known to be challenging when using usual Godunov-type finite volume schemes. At last, the scheme should be positive which means that the water height stays positive for all time. Our approach is based on a Lagrange-projection decomposition which allows to naturally decouple the acoustic and transport terms. Numerical experiments on unstructured meshes illustrate the good behaviour of the scheme.","math.NA,math.AP,physics.class-ph",2019,human

By projecting two nonadjacent photons onto circular polarization bases we disentangle the spin from the photons emitted in between, thus continuously and deterministically preparing all-photonic cluster states for the first time.

This novel result is achieved by simply decomposing the particle-hole propagator into the vacuum propagator plus a medium-insertion and correcting for certain symmetry factors in the $(n-1)$-th power of the in-medium loop. Known results for the low-density expansion up to and including order $a^4$ are accurately reproduced. The emerging series in $a k_f$ can be summed to all orders in the form of a double-integral over an arctangent function. In that representation the unitary limit $a\to \infty$ can be taken and one obtains the value $ξ= 0.5067$ for the universal Bertsch parameter.

We propose two criteria to avoid these drawbacks. The outcome is an algorithm that explores a much smaller search space and guarantees that every maximal clique-partition is computed only once.

Unlike previous methods that relied on hand-crafted directional features, the proposed model trains DOA embeddings from scratch using speech enhancement loss, making it suitable for low-latency scenarios. Additionally, it operates at a high frame rate, taking in DOA with each input frame, which brings in the capability of quickly adapting to changing scene in highly dynamic real-world scenarios.

Although some methods combining traditional optimization algorithms with DNNs have been proposed, they all have some limitations. In this paper, we propose a three-granularity memory layer and contrast learning named MemoryNet, specifically, dividing the samples into positive, negative, and actual three samples for contrastive learning, where the memory layer is able to preserve the deep features of the image and the contrastive learning converges the learned features to balance. Experiments on Derain/Deshadow/Deblur task demonstrate that these methods are effective in improving restoration performance. In addition, this paper's model obtains significant PSNR, SSIM gain on three datasets with different degradation types, which is a strong proof that the recovered images are perceptually realistic.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03344v4,OVANet: One-vs-All Network for Universal Domain Adaptation,"Universal Domain Adaptation (UNDA) aims to handle both domain-shift and category-shift between two datasets, where the main challenge is to transfer knowledge while rejecting unknown classes which are absent in the labeled source data but present in the unlabeled target data. Existing methods manually set a threshold to reject unknown samples based on validation or a pre-defined ratio of unknown samples, but this strategy is not practical. In this paper, we propose a method to learn the threshold using source samples and to adapt it to the target domain. Our idea is that a minimum inter-class distance in the source domain should be a good threshold to decide between known or unknown in the target. To learn the inter-and intra-class distance, we propose to train a one-vs-all classifier for each class using labeled source data. Then, we adapt the open-set classifier to the target domain by minimizing class entropy. The resulting framework is the simplest of all baselines of UNDA and is insensitive to the value of a hyper-parameter yet outperforms baselines with a large margin.",cs.CV,2021,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06963v1,Catch'Em All: Locating Multiple Diffusion Sources in Networks with Partial Observations,"This paper studies the problem of locating multiple diffusion sources in networks with partial observations. We propose a new source localization algorithm, named Optimal-Jordan-Cover (OJC). The algorithm first extracts a subgraph using a candidate selection algorithm that selects source candidates based on the number of observed infected nodes in their neighborhoods. Then, in the extracted subgraph, OJC finds a set of nodes that ""cover"" all observed infected nodes with the minimum radius. The set of nodes is called the Jordan cover, and is regarded as the set of diffusion sources. Considering the heterogeneous susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) diffusion in the Erdos-Renyi (ER) random graph, we prove that OJC can locate all sources with probability one asymptotically with partial observations. OJC is a polynomial-time algorithm in terms of network size. However, the computational complexity increases exponentially in $m,$ the number of sources. We further propose a low-complexity heuristic based on the K-Means for approximating the Jordan cover, named Approximate-Jordan-Cover (AJC). Simulations on random graphs and real networks demonstrate that both AJC and OJC significantly outperform other heuristic algorithms.",cs.SI,2016,human

Almost all states of the system and the environment are pretty lazy-their entropy rates are low for any coupling to the environment.","quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech",2011,human

Achieving single-shot readout is challenging for solid-state qubits. For Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, it has been realized using nuclear memories or resonant excitation at cryogenic temperature. All of these existing approaches have stringent experimental demands. In particular, they require a high efficiency of photon collection, such as immersion optics or all-diamond micro-optics. For some of the most relevant applications, such as shallow implanted NV centers in a cryogenic environment, these tools are unavailable. Here we demonstrate an all-optical spin readout scheme that achieves single-shot fidelity even if photon collection is poor (delivering less than 10$^3$ clicks/second). The scheme is based on spin-dependent resonant excitation at cryogenic temperature combined with spin-to-charge conversion, mapping the fragile electron spin states to the stable charge states. We prove this technique to work on shallow implanted NV centers as they are required for sensing and scalable NV-based quantum registers.",quant-ph,2020,human

Once the beamline bends, the introduction of dispersion creates a coupling between the transverse and longitudinal planes. If this coupling is handled properly, one can achieve cooling in all three phase space planes. This is usually done by placing a wedge-shaped absorber in a region where there is dispersion. I will demonstrate using an eigenvalue analysis that there are other configurations of dispersion and absorber shape that will achieve ionization cooling in all phase space planes. In particular, I will show that a one can even achieve cooling in all phase planes with a parallel-faced absorber in a dispersion-free region. I will use perturbation theory to approximate the change in the cooling rates due to longitudinal-transverse coupling. I will then describe how the cooling of longitudinal oscillations can be understood via the projection of the ""longitudinal"" eigenmodes into the transverse plane.",physics.acc-ph,2006,human

Then we give many support evidence, including proofs using the Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formula and Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten (BCFW) recursive relation. As a byproduct, two types of generalized BCJ relations for multitrace EYM are further proposed, which will be useful in the BCFW proof. After one applies the recursive expansions repeatedly, any multitrace EYM amplitudes can be given in the Kleiss-Kuijf (KK) basis of tree level color ordered Yang-Mills (YM) amplitudes.

We introduce two different schemes by which any arbitrary unitary time evolution and measurement can be implemented with desired accuracy by using rotationally invariant Hamiltonians that act on the given system and two ancillary systems serving as reference frames. These frames specify the z and x directions and are independent of the desired time evolution. We also investigate the effects of quantum fluctuations that inevitably arise due to usage of a finite system as a reference frame and estimate how fast these fluctuations tend to zero when the size of the reference frame tends to infinity.

Areas with |b|<30 deg. and declination <-30 deg. are also rejected due to the high or uncertain neutral hydrogen absorption. Cross-correlation of our sample with the Hamburg/RASS optical identification catalogue, suggests that the vast majority of our sources are indeed AGN. A 4.1 sigma correlation signal between 0 and 8 degrees was detected with w(theta<8 deg.)=0.025 +- 0.006. Assuming the usual power-law form of the 2-point correlation function we find an angular correlationlength of 0.062 degrees. Deprojection on 3 dimensions, using the Limber's equation, yields a spatial correlation length of 6.0+- 1.6 h^-1 Mpc.

Our proof is built upon the recently developed connections between the Glauber dynamics for spin systems and the high-dimensional expander walks.

This flexibility allows ElasticAST to maintain evaluation capabilities at various lengths or resolutions and achieve similar performance to standard ASTs trained at specific lengths or resolutions.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01842v2,An Improved One-to-All Broadcasting in Higher Dimensional Eisenstein-Jacobi Networks,"Recently, a higher dimensional Eisenstein-Jacobi networks, has been proposed in [22], which is shown that they have better average distance with more number of nodes than a single dimensional EJ networks. Some communication algorithms such as one-to-all and all-to-all communications are well known and used in interconnection networks. In one-to-all communication, a source node sends a message to every other node in the network. Whereas, in all-to-all communication, every node is considered as a source node and sends its message to every other node in the network. In this paper, an improved one-to-all communication algorithm in higher dimensional EJ networks is presented. The paper shows that the proposed algorithm achieves a lower average number of steps to receiving the broadcasted message. In addition, since the links are assumed to be half-duplex, the all-to-all broadcasting algorithm is divided into three phases. The simulation results are discussed and showed that the improved one-to-all algorithm achieves better traffic performance than the well-known one-to-all algorithm and has 2.7% less total number of senders",cs.DC,2016,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00279v2,Elimination of All Bad Local Minima in Deep Learning,"In this paper, we theoretically prove that adding one special neuron per output unit eliminates all suboptimal local minima of any deep neural network, for multi-class classification, binary classification, and regression with an arbitrary loss function, under practical assumptions. At every local minimum of any deep neural network with these added neurons, the set of parameters of the original neural network (without added neurons) is guaranteed to be a global minimum of the original neural network. The effects of the added neurons are proven to automatically vanish at every local minimum. Moreover, we provide a novel theoretical characterization of a failure mode of eliminating suboptimal local minima via an additional theorem and several examples. This paper also introduces a novel proof technique based on the perturbable gradient basis (PGB) necessary condition of local minima, which provides new insight into the elimination of local minima and is applicable to analyze various models and transformations of objective functions beyond the elimination of local minima.","cs.LG,cs.NE,math.OC,stat.ML",2019,human

It is widely believed that individual eigenstates capture this breakdown of thermalization at finite size. We show that this belief is false in general and that a MBL system can exhibit the eigenstate properties of a thermalizing system. We propose that localized approximately conserved operators (l$^*$-bits) underlie localization in such systems. In dimensions $d>1$, we further argue that the existing MBL phenomenology is unstable to boundary effects and gives way to l$^*$-bits. Physical consequences of l$^*$-bits include the possibility of an eigenstate phase transition within the MBL phase unrelated to the dynamical transition in $d=1$ and thermal eigenstates at all parameters in $d>1$. Near-term experiments in ultra-cold atomic systems and numerics can probe the dynamics generated by boundary layers and emergence of l$^*$-bits.","cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.stat-mech",2016,human

http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13923v1,SLOVA: Uncertainty Estimation Using Single Label One-Vs-All Classifier,"Deep neural networks present impressive performance, yet they cannot reliably estimate their predictive confidence, limiting their applicability in high-risk domains. We show that applying a multi-label one-vs-all loss reveals classification ambiguity and reduces model overconfidence. The introduced SLOVA (Single Label One-Vs-All) model redefines typical one-vs-all predictive probabilities to a single label situation, where only one class is the correct answer. The proposed classifier is confident only if a single class has a high probability and other probabilities are negligible. Unlike the typical softmax function, SLOVA naturally detects out-of-distribution samples if the probabilities of all other classes are small. The model is additionally fine-tuned with exponential calibration, which allows us to precisely align the confidence score with model accuracy. We verify our approach on three tasks. First, we demonstrate that SLOVA is competitive with the state-of-the-art on in-distribution calibration. Second, the performance of SLOVA is robust under dataset shifts. Finally, our approach performs extremely well in the detection of out-of-distribution samples. Consequently, SLOVA is a tool that can be used in various applications where uncertainty modeling is required.",cs.LG,2022,human

Unless they are found analytically, there is, however, no efficient method to obtain 'all' the SPs of a given potential. We introduce a novel method, called the numerical polynomial homotopy continuation (NPHC) method, which numerically finds all the SPs, and is 'embarrassingly parallelizable'. The method requires the non-linearity of the potential to be polynomial-like, which is the case for almost all of the potentials arising in physical and chemical systems. We also certify the numerically obtained SPs so that they are independent of the numerical tolerance used during the computation. It is then straightforward to separate out the local and global minima. As a first application, we take the XY model with power-law interaction which is shown to have a polynomial-like non-linearity and apply the method.","cond-mat.stat-mech,hep-th,math.DS",2011,human

By analysing the differential equation of the generating series we construct a solution for its low-energy expansion to all orders in the inverse string tension $α'$. Our solution is expressed through initial data involving multiple zeta values and certain real-analytic functions of the modular parameter of the torus. These functions are built from real and imaginary parts of holomorphic iterated Eisenstein integrals and should be closely related to Brown's recent construction of real-analytic modular forms. We study the properties of our real-analytic objects in detail and give explicit examples to a fixed order in the $α'$-expansion. In particular, our solution allows for a counting of linearly independent modular graph forms at a given weight, confirming previous partial results and giving predictions for higher, hitherto unexplored weights. It also sheds new light on the topic of uniform transcendentality of the $α'$-expansion.","hep-th,math.NT",2020,human

However, it is a phenomenological fact that all-to-all strongly coupled limit-cycle oscillators may behave as ""quasiphase oscillators"", evidencing the need of novel reduction strategies. We introduce here quasi phase reduction (QPR), a scheme suited for identical oscillators with polar symmetry ($λ-ω$ systems). By applying QPR we achieve a reduction to $N+2$ degrees of freedom: $N$ phase oscillators interacting through one independent complex variable. This ""quasi phase model"" is asymptotically valid in the neighborhood of incoherent states, irrespective of the coupling strength. The effectiveness of QPR is illustrated in a particular case, an ensemble of Stuart-Landau oscillators, obtaining exact stability boundaries of uniform and nonuniform incoherent states for a variety of couplings. An extension of QPR beyond the neighborhood of incoherence is also explored.

In this position paper, we advocate for charting the world's model population in a unified structure we call the Model Atlas: a graph that captures models, their attributes, and the weight transformations that connect them. The Model Atlas enables applications in model forensics, meta-ML research, and model discovery, challenging tasks given today's unstructured model repositories. However, because most models lack documentation, large atlas regions remain uncharted. Addressing this gap motivates new machine learning methods that treat models themselves as data, inferring properties such as functionality, performance, and lineage directly from their weights. We argue that a scalable path forward is to bypass the unique parameter symmetries that plague model weights. Charting all the world's models will require a community effort, and we hope its broad utility will rally researchers toward this goal.","cs.LG,cs.CL,cs.CV",2025,human

Besides handcrafted approaches aiming at making deep models hardware-friendly, Neural Architectures Search is rising as a toolbox to craft more efficient DNNs without sacrificing performance. Among these, the Once-For-All (OFA) approach offers a solution by allowing the sampling of well-performing sub-networks from a single supernet -- this leads to evident advantages in terms of computation. However, OFA does not fully utilize the potential memory capacity of the target device, focusing instead on limiting maximum memory usage per layer. This leaves room for an unexploited potential in terms of model generalizability. In this paper, we introduce a Memory-Optimized OFA (MOOFA) supernet, designed to enhance DNN deployment on resource-limited devices by maximizing memory usage (and for instance, features diversity) across different configurations.

The solutions fall into two classes depending on whether the Killing vector constructed from the Killing spinor is time-like or null. When it is timelike, the solutions are determined by a four-dimensional Kahler base-manifold, up to an anti-holomorphic function, and generically preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry. When it is null we provide a precise prescription for constructing the solutions and we show that they generically preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry. We show that $AdS_5$ is the unique maximally supersymmetric configuration. The formalism is used to construct some new solutions, including a non-singular deformation of $AdS_5$, which can be uplifted to obtain new solutions of type IIB supergravity",hep-th,2003,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01816v2,Class Symbolic Regression: Gotta Fit 'Em All,"We introduce 'Class Symbolic Regression' (Class SR) a first framework for automatically finding a single analytical functional form that accurately fits multiple datasets - each realization being governed by its own (possibly) unique set of fitting parameters. This hierarchical framework leverages the common constraint that all the members of a single class of physical phenomena follow a common governing law. Our approach extends the capabilities of our earlier Physical Symbolic Optimization ($Φ$-SO) framework for Symbolic Regression, which integrates dimensional analysis constraints and deep reinforcement learning for unsupervised symbolic analytical function discovery from data. Additionally, we introduce the first Class SR benchmark, comprising a series of synthetic physical challenges specifically designed to evaluate such algorithms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our novel approach by applying it to these benchmark challenges and showcase its practical utility for astrophysics by successfully extracting an analytic galaxy potential from a set of simulated orbits approximating stellar streams.","cs.LG,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.IM,physics.comp-ph",2023,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09445v1,All elastic amplitudes in the (black hole) eikonal phase,"In this article we calculate the eikonal scattering amplitude for an arbitrary number of in- and out-particles, using covariant quantization in a spherical harmonics basis on the Schwarzschild background. We extend prior results to resummation over all partial waves, restoring contributions from transverse separation and correctly taking into account the particle masses in the pole structure. We consider leading order interactions mediated by scalar-scalar-graviton vertices and scalar electrodynamics. We perform our calculations in the black hole eikonal phase. The $2\to 2$ eikonal amplitude is measured by the transverse Green's function $(-Δ_Ω+a)G(Ω,Ω')=δ^{(2)}(Ω-Ω')$. As a consistency check, we use our formalism in flat space to find an exact match with the known flat space eikonal $2\to 2$ amplitude in literature. We then extend the eikonal amplitude to arbitrarily many particles for the first time in both flat space and on the black hole background. We show that the black hole amplitude matches the black hole S-matrix as derived by 't Hooft. We conclude that this amplitude provides the most general elastic contribution one can achieve in the eikonal phase.",hep-th,2025,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01715v3,Hamiltonian simulation with nearly optimal dependence on all parameters,"We present an algorithm for sparse Hamiltonian simulation whose complexity is optimal (up to log factors) as a function of all parameters of interest. Previous algorithms had optimal or near-optimal scaling in some parameters at the cost of poor scaling in others. Hamiltonian simulation via a quantum walk has optimal dependence on the sparsity at the expense of poor scaling in the allowed error. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query simulation provides optimal scaling in the error at the expense of poor scaling in the sparsity. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features of both. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with coefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm's complexity (as measured by the number of queries and 2-qubit gates) is logarithmic in the inverse error, and nearly linear in the product $τ$ of the evolution time, the sparsity, and the magnitude of the largest entry of the Hamiltonian. Our dependence on the error is optimal, and we prove a new lower bound showing that no algorithm can have sublinear dependence on $τ$.",quant-ph,2015,human

We call a set with this property \textit{super-dense}. The super-density of $\mathcal{N}^c$ illustrates further its topological size or geometric richness. Surprisingly, the measure-theoretically ``larger"" set of normal numbers $\mathcal{N}$ does not share this property and we give an explicit Cantor-type construction of a nowhere constant continuous function $\hat{C}$, which maps all normal numbers to non-normal numbers. Our final result discusses the relation between super-density and the Baire categories employing various set-theoretic strategies.","math.NT,math.GN",2025,human

In this paper, we introduce a corpus of short texts in the Romanian language, annotated with certain author characteristic keywords; to our knowledge, the first of its kind. In order to do this, we exploit a social media platform called Reddit. We leverage its thematic community-based structure (subreddits structure), which offers information about the author's background. We infer an user's demographic and some broad personal traits, such as age category, employment status, interests, and social orientation based on the subreddit and other cues. We thus obtain a 23k+ samples corpus, extracted from 100+ Romanian subreddits. We analyse our dataset, and finally, we fine-tune and evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) to prove baselines capabilities for authorship profiling using the corpus, indicating the need for further research in the field.

The dendrimers are higly branched organic macromolecules having repeated iterations of branched units that surroundes the central core. Dendrimers are used in a variety of fields including chemistry, nanotechnology, biology. In this paper, for any positive integer $\ell$, we count the number of paths of length $\ell$ of $T_{n, k}$. As a consequence of our main results, we obtain the average distance of $T_{n, k}$ which we can establish an alternate proof for the Wiener index of $T_{n, k}$.

This contrasts to Perelman's point-wise gradient estimate which works mainly for the fundamental solution rather than all solutions. Like Perelman's estimate, the most general form of our gradient estimate does not require any curvature assumption. Moreover, assuming only lower bound on the Ricci curvature, we also prove a localized gradient estimate similar to the Li-Yau estimate for the linear Schrödinger heat equation. The main difference with the linear case is that no assumptions on the derivatives of the potential (scalar curvature) are needed.   A generalization of Perelman's W-entropy is defined in both the Ricci flow and fixed metric case. We also find a new family of heat kernel estimates.",math.DG,2006,human

Pick gave a condition on the data $\{z_i, w_i:1\leq i\leq n\}$ for such an $interpolant$ to exist if $Ω=\mathbb{D}$. Nevanlinna characterized all possible functions $f$ that $interpolate$ the data. We generalize Nevanlinna's result to an arbitrary set $Ω$. In this case, the function $f$ comes from the Schur-Agler class.

We show that all combinations of paired data are not necessary to train such a joint embedding, and only image-paired data is sufficient to bind the modalities together. ImageBind can leverage recent large scale vision-language models, and extends their zero-shot capabilities to new modalities just by using their natural pairing with images. It enables novel emergent applications 'out-of-the-box' including cross-modal retrieval, composing modalities with arithmetic, cross-modal detection and generation. The emergent capabilities improve with the strength of the image encoder and we set a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot recognition tasks across modalities, outperforming specialist supervised models. Finally, we show strong few-shot recognition results outperforming prior work, and that ImageBind serves as a new way to evaluate vision models for visual and non-visual tasks.","cs.CV,cs.AI,cs.LG,cs.MM",2023,human

In gauge theories, planar loop integrands are subtle to defined and obtained due to the existence of scaleless integrals. A critical challenge arises when constructing higher-loop integrands via recursion methods: integrands with or without all scaleless terms both are incompatible with the reconstruction formalism in arXiv:2412.21027. To address this, we introduce a $\textit{refined}$ integrand by systematically removing specific scaleless contributions, and develop an algorithmic implementation of the recursion to all-loop level. We explicitly demonstrate the framework by three steps and obtain the recursion formula in pure Yang-Mills theory. In the ancillary files, we provide the results up to the two-loop five-point integrand and the simplified result in the large-$D$ limit for the three-loop four-point case.",hep-th,2025,human

We show that, in a certain kinematic regime characterised by a semi-classical positive energy condition, both off-shell currents and scattering amplitudes exhibit two novel factorisation structures. First, they may be written as currents in vacuum but with a single additional photon, averaged over the momentum of that photon. This converts the all-orders interaction with the PP-wave into a single effective interaction. Second, the currents and amplitudes may be written as a weighted average of the corresponding quantities in an impulsive plane wave background, with the average taken over all possible field strengths of the plane wave.

The entry $\ast$ places no restriction on the edges between the corresponding sets. This problem generalises graph colouring and graph homomorphism problems.   A graph with no $M$-partition but such that every proper subgraph does have an $M$-partition is called a minimal obstruction.

It is known that for the observation of nonlocality the measurements on a quantum system have to be incompatible, but the question which incompatible measurements are useful, remained open. Here we prove that any set of incompatible measurements on qubits leads to a violation of a suitable Bell inequality in a multiparticle scenario, where all parties perform the same set of measurements. Since there exists incompatible measurements on qubits which do not lead to Bell nonlocality for two particles, our results demonstrate a fundamental difference between two-particle and multi-particle nonlocality, pointing at the superactivation of measurement incompatibility as a resource. In addition, our results imply that measurement incompatibility for qubits can always be certified in a device-independent manner.",quant-ph,2024,human

These observations probe the universe on very different scales since they involve light beams of very different angular sizes; hence the tension between them may indicate that they should not be interpreted the same way. More precisely, this Letter questions the accuracy of using only the (perturbed) Friedmann-Lemaître geometry to interpret all the cosmological observations, regardless of their angular or spatial resolution. We show that using an inhomogeneous ""Swiss-cheese"" model to interpret the Hubble diagram allows to reconcile it with the Planck results.

We prove that these states are negligible in the whole Hilbert space: typically a state picked out at random has positive discord; and, given a state with zero discord, a generic arbitrarily small perturbation drives it to a positive-discord state. These results hold for any Hilbert-space dimension, and have direct implications on quantum computation and on the foundations of the theory of open systems. In addition, we provide a simple necessary criterion for zero quantum discord. Finally, we show that, for almost all positive-discord states, an arbitrary Markovian evolution cannot lead to a sudden, permanent vanishing of discord.",quant-ph,2009,human

Since then, many schemes of dynamical decoupling have been proposed to achieve high-order suppression, both analytically and numerically. However, hitherto, there has not been a systematic framework to understand all existing uniform $π$-pulse dynamical decoupling schemes. In this report, we use the projection pulse sequences as basic building blocks and concatenation as a way to combine them. We derived a new concatenated-projection dynamical decoupling (CPDD), a framework in which we can systematically construct pulse sequences to achieve arbitrary high suppression order. All previously known uniform dynamical decoupling sequences using $π$ pulse can be fit into this framework. Understanding uniform dynamical decoupling as successive projections on the Hamiltonian will also give insights on how to invent new ways to construct better pulse sequences.",quant-ph,2015,human

This naturally leads to the more stringent concept of AB-informationally complete measurements, by which one can estimate jointly all the moments of two incompatible observables A and B. After analyzing all general properties of such measurements, we address the problem of their optimality, and we completely solve the case of qubits, showing that a sigma_x sigma_y-infocomplete measurement is less noisy than any infocomplete one.

This information enabled us to obtain optical spectra of all these counterparts, since only three spectra are available on-line, but not flux calibrated, allowing us to reveal their real nature (Baumgartner et al. 2008 give only a tentative classification based upon their X-ray properties). Here we present the spectra, along with the corresponding finding charts obtained from the DSS-II red survey, of these 8 sources.

The current neutrino constraints from cosmology should be therefore regarded as robust, as they are not strongly dependent on the dark sector physics, once all the available observations are combined.

Nevertheless, numerous proposals transcend computability theory, in particular by emphasizing interaction of modules, or components, parts, constituents, as a fundamental computing feature. In a technical framework, interaction requires composition of modules. Hence, a most abstract, comprehensive theory of modules and their composition is required. To this end, we suggest a minimal set of postulates to characterize systems in the digital world that consist of interacting modules. For such systems, we suggest a calculus with a simple, yet most general composition operator which exhibits important properties, in particular associativity. We claim that this composition calculus provides not just another conceptual, formal framework, but that essentially all settings of modules and their composition can be based on this calculus. This claim is supported by a rich body of theorems, properties, special classes of modules, and case studies.","cs.SE,cs.FL",2024,human

In other words, the idea is to optimally allocate the generated and reserved powers based on nodes' local cost gradient information while meeting the demand energy. One main concern is the all-time (or anytime) resource-demand feasibility, implying that at all iterations of the scheduling algorithm, the balance between the produced power and demand plus reserved power must hold. The other concern is to design algorithms to tolerate communication time-delays and changes in the network. Further, one can incorporate possible model nonlinearity in the algorithm to address both inherent (e.g., saturation and quantization) and purposefully-added (e.g., signum-based) nonlinearities in the model. The proposed optimal allocation algorithm addresses all the above concerns, while it benefits from possible features of the distributed (or networked) solutions such as no-single-node-of-failure and distributed information processing.

In practice it is often the case to have a set (i.e. ensemble) of decisions that are used instead of a single decision only, in particular in complex systems. Unfortunately, explanation methods for single decision making systems are not easily applicable to ensembles -- i.e. they would yield an ensemble of individual explanations which are not necessarily consistent, hence less useful and more difficult to understand than a single consistent explanation of all observed phenomena.

Second, we prove that for each entangled state $σ$, there exists another state $ρ$ not violating CHSH, such that $ρ\otimesσ$ violates CHSH.

Amplification happens when a second (gate) chain is driven by a small signal in the counter phase and with the same frequency as first chain. If the total driving of both chains overcomes the band-gap transmission threshold the large amplitude band-gap soliton emerges and amplification scenario is realized. The mechanism is interpreted as nonlinear superposition of evanescent and propagating nonlinear modes manifesting in a single or double soliton generation working in band-gap or band-pass regimes, respectively.

We do so by constructing certain expander graphs, similar to Ramanujan graphs, with elliptic curves as nodes and low degree isogenies as edges.  The result is obtained from the rapid mixing of random walks on this graph. Our proof works only for curves with (nearly) the same endomorphism rings.

Instead of the real/fake discriminator used in vanilla GANs, we propose to extend the discriminator to a One-Vs-All classifier (GAN-OVA) that can distinguish each input data to its category label. Specifically, we feed certain additional information as conditions to the generator and take the discriminator as a One-Vs-All classifier to identify each conditional category. Our model can be applied to different divergence or distances used to define the objective function, such as Jensen-Shannon divergence and Earth-Mover (or called Wasserstein-1) distance. We evaluate GAN-OVAs on MNIST and CelebA-HQ datasets, and the experimental results show that GAN-OVAs make progress toward stable training over regular conditional GANs. Furthermore, GAN-OVAs effectively accelerate the generation process of different classes and improves generation quality.",cs.CV,2020,human

First, we are concerned with the classification of self-adjoint extensions of the Laplacian $-Δ\big|_{C^\infty_0(Ω)}$ in $L^2(Ω; d^n x)$. Here, the domain $Ω$ belongs to a subclass of bounded Lipschitz domains (which we term quasi-convex domains), which contain all convex domains, as well as all domains of class $C^{1,r}$, for $r\in(1/2,1)$. Second, we establish Krein-type formulas for the resolvents of the various self-adjoint extensions of the Laplacian in quasi-convex domains and study the properties of the corresponding Weyl--Titchmarsh operators (or energy-dependent Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps).   One significant technical innovation in this paper is an extension of the classical boundary trace theory for functions in spaces which lack Sobolev regularity in a traditional sense, but are suitably adapted to the Laplacian.","math.AP,math.SP",2009,human

Our approach is based on the application of the Dirac-Coulomb Green function and accounts for the interaction between the virtual electron-positron pair and the nucleus to all orders in the nuclear binding strength parameter $αZ$. Practical calculations are performed for the scattering of 2.754 MeV photons off plutonium atoms. We find that including the Coulomb corrections enhances the scattering cross section by up to 50% in this case. The obtained results resolve the long-standing discrepancy between experimental data and theoretical predictions and demonstrate that an accurate treatment of the Coulomb corrections is crucial for the interpretation of existing and guidance of future Delbrück scattering experiments on heavy atoms.,physics.atom-ph,2023,human

I prove a theorem similar to Lovelock's, with a physically modified assumption: that the geometric object representing curvature in the Einstein field equation ought to have the physical dimension of stress-energy. The theorem is stronger than Lovelock's in two ways: it holds in all dimensions, and so supports a generalized argument for uniqueness; it does not assume that the desired tensor depends on the metric only up second-order partial-derivatives, that condition being a consequence of the proof. This has consequences for understanding the nature of the cosmological constant and theories of higher-dimensional gravity. Another consequence of the theorem is that it makes precise the sense in which there can be no gravitational stress-energy tensor in general relativity.

While significant progress has been made on individual tasks, this paper presents for the first time an all-neural approach to simultaneous speaker counting, diarization and source separation. The NN-based estimator operates in a block-online fashion and tracks speakers even if they remain silent for a number of time blocks, thus learning a stable output order for the separated sources. The neural network is recurrent over time as well as over the number of sources.

Robustness against the numerical instabilities is achieved by scaling the velocity reconstruction function in the vicinity of shock with a multi-dimensional pressure sensor. The ability of the proposed scheme to resolve low Mach flow features is demonstrated through asymptotic analysis while stability of the proposed scheme for strong shock is demonstrated through linear perturbation and matrix stability analyses.

We also prove an EPPA analogue of the main results of J. Hubička and J. Nešetřil: All those Ramsey classes (Ramsey classes with closures and forbidden homomorphisms), thereby establishing a common framework for proving EPPA and the Ramsey property.

We find a coordinate reparameterisation in which the μ_i variables are replaced by [D/2]-1 unconstrained coordinates y_α, and having the remarkable property that the Kerr-AdS metric becomes diagonal in the coordinate differentials dy_α. The coordinates r and y_αnow appear in a very symmetrical way in the metric, leading to an immediate generalisation in which we can introduce [D/2]-1 NUT parameters. We find that (D-5)/2 are non-trivial in odd dimensions, whilst (D-2)/2 are non-trivial in even dimensions. This gives the most general Kerr-NUT-AdS metric in $D$ dimensions. We find that in all dimensions D\ge4 there exist discrete symmetries that involve inverting a rotation parameter through the AdS radius. These symmetries imply that Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics with over-rotating parameters are equivalent to under-rotating metrics. We also consider the BPS limit of the Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics, and thereby obtain, in odd dimensions and after Euclideanisation, new families of Einstein-Sasaki metrics.","hep-th,gr-qc",2006,human

We perform a self-consistent Hartree-Fock study that incorporates these effects alongside realistic interaction and substrate potentials, and explore a comprehensive set of competing orders including those that break translational symmetry at arbitrary wavevectors. We find that at all non-zero integer fillings very small strains, comparable to those measured in scanning tunneling experiments, stabilize a fundamentally new type of time-reversal symmetric and spatially non-uniform order. This order, which we dub the 'incommensurate Kekulé spiral' (IKS) order, spontaneously breaks both the emergent valley-charge conservation and moiré translation symmetries, but preserves a modified translation symmetry $\hat{T}'$ -- which simultaneously shifts the spatial coordinates and rotates the $U(1)$ angle which characterizes the spontaneous inter-valley coherence. We discuss the phenomenological and microscopic properties of this order. We argue that our findings are consistent with all experimental observations reported so far, suggesting a unified explanation of the global phase diagram in terms of the IKS order.","cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mes-hall",2021,human

In the null-recurrent regime, three distinct behaviors arise. Points satisfying certain combinatorial conditions (in particular, this class is generic in the measure-theoretic sense) exhibit fractional Poisson limits, whereas periodic points yield compound fractional Poisson limits. For all remaining points, we describe the full family of possible limit laws, each Pareto-dominated. This classification is sharp: every limit behavior in this family can be realized by an explicit system. For canonical families of null-recurrent CMS, we identify the limit process for every point, providing a complete description of return-time statistics in these systems.","math.DS,math.PR",2025,human

In some cases ($1$-bend and $2$-bend RAC-graphs and fan-crossing / fan-planar graphs), we thereby obtain the first tight upper bounds on the edge density of the respective graph classes. In other cases, we give new streamlined and significantly shorter proofs for bounds that were already known in the literature. Thanks to the Density Formula, all of our proofs are mostly elementary counting and mostly circumvent the typical intricate case analysis found in earlier proofs. Further, in some cases (simple and non-homotopic quasiplanar graphs), our alternative proofs using the Density Formula lead to the first tight lower bound examples.","math.CO,cs.DM",2023,human

The loop-tree duality is a novel method aimed at overcoming this bottleneck by opening the loop amplitudes into trees and combining them at integrand level with the real-emission matrix elements. In this Letter, we generalize the loop-tree duality to all orders in the perturbative expansion by using the complex Lorentz-covariant prescription of the original one-loop formulation. We introduce a series of mutiloop topologies with arbitrary internal configurations and derive very compact and factorizable expressions of their open-to-trees representation in the loop-tree duality formalism. Furthermore, these expressions are entirely independent at integrand level of the initial assignments of momentum flows in the Feynman representation and remarkably free of noncausal singularities. These properties, that we conjecture to hold to other topologies at all orders, provide integrand representations of scattering amplitudes that exhibit manifest causal singular structures and better numerical stability than in other representations.","hep-ph,hep-th",2020,human

This work explores why these schemes succeed or fail with the accuracy and checkerboard problems. Comparison and analysis show that the accuracy and checkerboard problems are caused by the order of the sound speed being too large and too small in the coefficients of the velocity-derivative and pressure-derivative dissipation terms, respectively. These problems can be resolved by choosing coefficients with zero-order sound speed. In addition, to avoid the negative effects of the global cut-off strategy on accuracy while maintaining computational stability, the sound speed terms in the numerator of the coefficients can be determined by local variables, while those in the denominator remain the global cut-off. Two novel schemes are proposed as examples to demonstrate how these ideas can be applied to construct more satisfactory schemes for all-speed flows.

The entangling unitary transformations are parametrized by sets of angles. For a given member of the set of all-bands-flat, additional short-range nonlinear interactions destroy caging in general, and induce transport.

Classifiers trained on PAIReD jets also have significantly better background rejections compared to those based on traditional event reconstruction approaches using small-radius jets at low Lorentz boost regimes.

http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0106284v2,Holography&Transplantation and All That (The tip of an iceberg for a paradigmatic change in QFT?),"Recent developments in local quantum physics have led to revolutionary conceptual changes in the thinking about a more intrinsic formulation and in particular about unexpected aspects of localized degrees of freedom. This paradigmatic change is most spectacular in a new rigorous form of ``holography'' and ``transplantation'' as generic properties in QFT beyond the rather special geometric black hole setting in which the geometric manifestations of these properties were first noted. This new setting is also the natural arena for understanding the rich world of ``black hole analogs'' (``dumb holes'' for phonons). The mathematical basis for all this is the extremely powerful Tomita-Takesaki modular theory in operator algebras. The rich consequences of the impressive blend of this theory with physical localization entails among other things the presence of ``fuzzy'' acting infinite dimensional symmetry groups, a spacetime interpretation and derivation of the d=1+1 Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra (i.e. a better understanding of the bootstrap-formfactor approach) and the noncommutative multiparticle structure of ``free'' anyons based on the use of Wigner representation theory.","hep-th,gr-qc,math-ph,quant-ph",2001,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01058v3,Coarse-grained graph architectures for all-atom force predictions,"We introduce a machine-learning framework termed coarse-grained all-atom force field (CGAA-FF), which incorporates coarse-grained message passing within an all-atom force field using equivariant nature of graph models. The CGAA-FF model employs grain embedding to encode atomistic coordinates into nodes representing grains rather than individual atoms, enabling predictions of both grain-level energies and atom-level forces. Tested on organic electrolytes, CGAA-FF achieves root-mean-square errors of 4.96 meV atom-1 for energy and 0.201 eV A-1 for force predictions. CGAA-FF significantly reduces computational costs, achieving about 22- and 14-fold improvements in simulation speed and memory efficiency, respectively, compared to the all-atom potential (SevenNet-0). Since this CGAA framework can be integrated into any equivariant architecture, we believe this work opens the door to efficient all-atom simulations of soft-matter systems.","cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.soft",2025,human

Then it is shown that the integrability condition of maximally isotropic distributions can be described in terms of the invariance of certain subbundles under the action of these operators. Here it is also proved a new generalization of the Goldberg-Sachs theorem, valid in all even dimensions, stating that the existence of an integrable maximally isotropic distribution imposes restrictions on the optical matrix.

In this work we, show that, at least for simple inflationary potentials, one can find the primordial scalar and tensor power spectra exactly by resumming over all the running terms. In this model-dependent method, we expand the power spectra about the pivot scale to find the series terms as functions of the e-folding number for some single field models of inflation. Interestingly, for the viable models studied here, one can sum over all the terms and evaluate the exact form of the power spectra. This in turn gives more accurate parametrization of the specific models studied in this work. We finally compare our results with the recent cosmic microwave background data to find that our new power spectra are in good agreement with the data.","astro-ph.CO,hep-ph,hep-th",2014,human

A model based on these modes is presented, giving a clear physical explanation of all features in the extinction spectrum. Counter-intuitively, this can show negative contributions to extinction, which are shown to arise from the interference between non-orthogonal modes. The direct and interference contributions to extinction are determined, showing that conservation of energy is preserved. The Huygens' condition of matched electric and magnetic dipole moments leads to strong forward scattering and suppressed back scattering. It is shown that higher order modes with appropriate symmetry generalise this condition, leading to multiple bands of directional scattering. The presented results are obtained using a robust approach to find the modes of nano-photonic scatterers, commonly referred to as quasi-normal modes. By utilising an integral formulation of Maxwell's equations, this work avoids the problem of normalising diverging far-fields, which other approaches require.

This paper introduces an inexpensive, modular, robust, and scalable platform -- the DManus -- aimed at resolving these challenges while satisfying the large-scale data collection capabilities demanded by deep robot learning paradigms. Studies on human manipulation point to the criticality of low-level tactile feedback in performing everyday dexterous tasks. The DManus comes with ReSkin sensing on the entire surface of the palm as well as the fingertips. We demonstrate effectiveness of the fully integrated system in a tactile aware task -- bin picking and sorting.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09689v1,All-condition pulse detection using a magnetic sensor,"A plethora of wearable devices have been developed or commercialized for continuous non-invasive monitoring of physiological signals that are crucial for preventive care and management of chronic conditions. However, most of these devices are either sensitive to skin conditions or its interface with the skin due to the requirement that the external stimuli such as light or electrical excitation must penetrate the skin to detect the pulse. This often results in large motion artefacts and unsuitability for certain skin conditions. Here, we demonstrate a simple fingertip-type device which can detect clear pulse signals under all conditions, including fingers covered by opaque substances such as a plaster or nail polish, or fingers immersed in liquid. The device has a very simple structure, consisting of only a pair of magnets and a magnetic sensor. We show through both experiments and simulations that the detected pulsation signals correspond directly to the magnet vibrations caused by blood circulation, and therefore, in addition to heartrate detection, the proposed device can also be potentially used for blood pressure measurement.",eess.SP,2023,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08695v1,DialogXL: All-in-One XLNet for Multi-Party Conversation Emotion Recognition,"This paper presents our pioneering effort for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) with pre-trained language models. Unlike regular documents, conversational utterances appear alternately from different parties and are usually organized as hierarchical structures in previous work. Such structures are not conducive to the application of pre-trained language models such as XLNet. To address this issue, we propose an all-in-one XLNet model, namely DialogXL, with enhanced memory to store longer historical context and dialog-aware self-attention to deal with the multi-party structures. Specifically, we first modify the recurrence mechanism of XLNet from segment-level to utterance-level in order to better model the conversational data. Second, we introduce dialog-aware self-attention in replacement of the vanilla self-attention in XLNet to capture useful intra- and inter-speaker dependencies. Extensive experiments are conducted on four ERC benchmarks with mainstream models presented for comparison. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines on all the datasets. Several other experiments such as ablation study and error analysis are also conducted and the results confirm the role of the critical modules of DialogXL.","cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.IR,cs.LG",2020,human

Based on the factorization structure encoded in the same way by two different recursion relations, we conjecture an all-multiplicity formula for two gauged massive particles of arbitrary spin and any number of identical-helicity gluons. Specializing to quantum chromodynamics (QCD), we solve the on-shell recursion relations in the presence of two pairs of massive quarks and an arbitrary number of identical-helicity gluons. We find closed-form expressions for the two distinct families of color-ordered four-quark amplitudes, in which all gluons comprise a single color-adjacent set. We compare the efficiency of the numerical evaluation of the two resulting analytic formulae against a numerical implementation of the off-shell Berends-Giele recursion. We find the formulae for both amplitude families to be faster for large multiplicities, while the simpler of the two is actually faster for any number of external legs.

A rainbow basis is a maximum independent set in which each element receives a different color. The rank of a subset $S$ of $E$, denoted by $r_M(S)$, is the maximum size of an independent set in $S$. A flat $F$ is a maximal set in $M$ with a fixed rank. The anti-Ramsey number of $t$ pairwise disjoint rainbow bases in $M$, denoted by $ar(M,t)$, is defined as the maximum number of colors $m$ such that there exists an $m$ coloring of the ground set $E$ of $M$ which contains no $t$ pairwise disjoint rainbow bases. We determine $ar(M,t)$ for all matroids of rank at least 2: $ar(M,t)=|E|$ if there exists a flat $F_0$ with $|E|-|F_0|<t(r_M(E)-r_M(F_0))$; and $ar(M,t)=\max_{F\colon r_M(F)\leq r_M(E)-2} \{|F|+t(r_M(E)-r_M(F)-1)\}$ otherwise.

This is a much studied area with numerous careful, and sometimes complex, approaches and training schemes including: self-supervised learning, learning from synthetic datasets, object-centric representations, amodal representations, and many more. Our interest in this paper is to determine if the Segment Anything model (SAM) can contribute to this task. We investigate two models for combining SAM with optical flow that harness the segmentation power of SAM with the ability of flow to discover and group moving objects. In the first model, we adapt SAM to take optical flow, rather than RGB, as an input. In the second, SAM takes RGB as an input, and flow is used as a segmentation prompt. These surprisingly simple methods, without any further modifications, outperform all previous approaches by a considerable margin in both single and multi-object benchmarks. We also extend these frame-level segmentations to sequence-level segmentations that maintain object identity. Again, this simple model achieves outstanding performance across multiple moving object segmentation benchmarks.",cs.CV,2024,human

Its all-photonic version - mediated by the interference of photon pairs generated by separate quantum systems-finds disparate applications in quantum networks. So far, all-photonic entanglement swapping between remote systems has been implemented only using sources that operate probabilistically. However, the scaling up of quantum networks requires deterministic quantum emitters that do not suffer from a trade-off between degree of entanglement and photonpair generation rate. Here, we demonstrate all-photonic entanglement swapping using photon-pairs generated by two separate GaAs quantum dots. The emitters are deterministically embedded in hybrid semiconductor-piezoelectric devices that make the entangled-photons from two dissimilar quantum dots nearly identical. Entanglement swapping is demonstrated with a fidelity as high as 0.71(2), more than 10 standard deviations above the classical limit. The experimental data are quantitatively explained by a theoretical model that also suggests how to boost the protocol performances.

To overcome the inherent limitation of threshold-based pseudo-labeling, prior studies have attempted to align the confidence threshold with the evolving learning status of the model, which is estimated through the predictions made on the unlabeled data. In this paper, we further reveal that classifier weights can reflect the differentiated learning status across categories and consequently propose a class-specific adaptive threshold mechanism. Additionally, considering that even the optimal threshold scheme cannot resolve the problem of discarding unlabeled samples, a binary classification consistency regulation approach is designed to distinguish candidate classes from negative options for all unlabeled samples. By combining the above strategies, we present a novel SSL algorithm named AllMatch, which achieves improved pseudo-label accuracy and a 100% utilization ratio for the unlabeled data. We extensively evaluate our approach on multiple benchmarks, encompassing both balanced and imbalanced settings.

These contextual influences are very different, say, in classical kinetic theory and in the entanglement paradigm of quantum mechanics, which are traditionally interpreted as representing different forms of physical determinism. One can mathematically construct systems with other types of contextuality, whether or not empirically realizable: those that form special cases of the classical type, those that fall between the classical and quantum ones, and those that violate the quantum type.

To manifest nonlocality, it requires, in the simplest scenario, two measurements performed randomly by each of two distant observers. In this work, we propose a novel framework where three measurements, two on Alice's side and one on Bob's side, suffice to reveal quantum nonlocality and hence does not require all-out randomness in measurement choice.

We start from a small volume, where one can use a standard O(a)-improved relativistic action for the b-quark, and compute two step scaling functions which relate the observables to the large volume ones. In all steps we extrapolate to the continuum limit, separately in HQET and in QCD for masses below m_b. The physical point m_b is then reached by an interpolation of the continuum results in 1/m. The essential, expected and verified, feature is that the step scaling fuctions have a weak mass-dependence resulting in an easy interpolation to the physical point.

This result is also the first proof that \emph{exact} SVP$_p$ is NP-hard in a finite $\ell_p$ norm. Hardness for SVP$_p$ with $p$ finite was previously only known if NP $\not \subseteq$ RP, and under that assumption, hardness of approximation was only known for all constant factors. As a corollary to our main theorem, we show that under the Sliding Scale Conjecture, SVP$_p$ is NP-hard to approximate within a small polynomial factor, for all constants $p > 2$.   Our proof techniques are surprisingly elementary; we reduce from a \emph{regularized} PCP instance directly to the shortest vector problem by using simple gadgets related to Vandermonde matrices and Hadamard matrices.",cs.CC,2025,human

We show that this blowup profile is globally nonlinearly stable for all $d \geq 3$, thereby verifying a perturbative version of the conjecture posed in \cite{BizBie15} about the generic large data blowup behavior for this model. To accomplish this, we develop a novel stability analysis approach based on similarity variables posed on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$. As a result, we draw a general road map for studying spatially global stability of self-similar blowup profiles for nonlinear wave equations in the radial case for arbitrary dimension $d \geq 3$.","math.AP,math-ph,math.DG",2022,human

An important prerequisite for the operation of optical clocks are magic trapping conditions, where electronic and motional dynamics decouple. Here, we identify and experimentally demonstrate simultaneous magic trapping for two clock transitions in strontium-88, realizing so-called triple-magic conditions at a specially chosen magic angle. Under these conditions, we operate an all-optical qutrit comprising the ground state $^1S_0$, and the two metastable clock states $^3P_0$ and $^3P_2$. We demonstrate fast optical control in an atom array using two- and three-photon couplings to realize high-fidelity manipulation between all qutrit states. At the magic angle, we probe the coherence achievable in magic-angle-tuned traps and find atom-atom coherence times between the metastable states as long as 715(30) ms.

Developing a comprehensive model to capture these structures has been a significant challenge in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Prior research has mainly focused on addressing individual tasks for specific hierarchical levels, rather than providing a unified approach. In this paper, we introduce a versatile, all-in-one model that jointly performs beat and downbeat tracking as well as functional structure segmentation and labeling. The model leverages source-separated spectrograms as inputs and employs dilated neighborhood attentions to capture temporal long-term dependencies, along with non-dilated attentions for local instrumental dependencies. Consequently, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in all four tasks on the Harmonix Set while maintaining a relatively lower number of parameters compared to recent state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, our ablation study demonstrates that the concurrent learning of beats, downbeats, and segments can lead to enhanced performance, with each task mutually benefiting from the others.",eess.AS,2023,human

Although this forecasting problem can be formulated as a multivariate time-series forecasting task, the current approaches cannot fully exploit the ever-changing multi-context correlations among POIs. Therefore, we propose Busyness Graph Neural Network (BysGNN), a temporal graph neural network designed to learn and uncover the underlying multi-context correlations between POIs for accurate visit forecasting. Unlike other approaches where only time-series data is used to learn a dynamic graph, BysGNN utilizes all contextual information and time-series data to learn an accurate dynamic graph representation.

Therefore, when performing long-form video question answering (LVQA), all information necessary to generate a correct response can often be contained within a small subset of frames. Recent literature explore use of large language models (LLMs) in LVQA benchmarks, achieving exceptional performance, while relying on vision language models (VLMs) to convert all visual content within videos into natural language. Such VLMs often independently caption a large number of frames uniformly sampled from long videos, which is not efficient and can mostly be redundant. Questioning these decision choices, we explore optimal strategies for key-frame selection that can significantly reduce these redundancies, namely Hierarchical Keyframe Selector.

Due to the weak nonlinearities in most integrated photonic platforms, realizing optical nonlinear functions typically requires large driving energies in the picojoules level or beyond, thus imposing a barrier for most applications. Here, we tackle this challenge and demonstrate an integrated nonlinear splitter device in lithium niobate nano-waveguides by simultaneous engineering of the dispersion and quasi-phase matching. We achieve non-resonant all-optical switching with ultra-low energies down to tens of femtojoules, a near instantaneous switching time of 18 fs, and a large extinction ratio of more than 5 dB. Our nonlinear splitter simultaneously realizes switch-on and -off operations and features a state-of-the-art switching energy-time product as low as $1.4 \times10^{-27}$ J$\cdot$s.

As such, the class of possible causal DAGs is represented by a maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graph (MPDAG), which contains both directed and undirected edges. We characterize the minimal additional edge orientations required to identify a given total effect. A recursive algorithm is then developed to enumerate subclasses of DAGs, such that the total effect in each subclass is identified as a distinct functional of the observed distribution. This resolves an issue with existing methods, which often report possible total effects with duplicates, namely those that are numerically distinct due to sampling variability but are in fact causally identical.","math.ST,stat.ME",2020,human

Using these elements, we propose an adaptive filtering algorithm with an LMS style update that estimates the FIR filter coefficients and the time delay.

The V-SMART-Join framework is applicable to sets, multisets, and vectors. V-SMART-Join is motivated by the observed skew in the underlying distributions of Internet traffic, and is a family of 2-stage algorithms, where the first stage computes and joins the partial results, and the second stage computes the similarity exactly for all candidate pairs. The V-SMART-Join algorithms are very efficient and scalable in the number of entities, as well as their cardinalities. They were up to 30 times faster than the state of the art algorithm, VCL, when compared on a real dataset of a small size. We also established the scalability of the proposed algorithms by running them on a dataset of a realistic size, on which VCL never succeeded to finish. Experiments were run using real datasets of IPs and cookies, where each IP is represented as a multiset of cookies, and the goal is to discover similar IPs to identify Internet proxies.",cs.DB,2012,human

After, we characterize the slices of the warped product $I\times_h\mathbb S^n$, under a suitable hypothesis on the warping function $h:I\subset\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$, as the only hypersurfaces which saturate a certain integral inequality involving the second eigenvalue of the Jacobi operator. As a consequence, we obtain that if $Σ$ is a closed immersed hypersurface of $\mathbb R\times\mathbb S^n$, then the second eigenvalue of the Jacobi operator of $Σ$ satisfies $λ_2\le n$ and the slices are the only hypersurfaces which satisfy $λ_2=n$.",math.DG,2018,human

This framework has three new elements: (1) updates to the model architecture and training, (2) using over one billion jets used for training, and (3) providing well-documented software for accessing all datasets and models. We demonstrate OmniLearned with three representative tasks: top-quark jet tagging with the community Delphes-based benchmark dataset, b-tagging with ATLAS full simulation, and anomaly detection with CMS experimental data.

To this end, we decompose the entropy production into a sum of information theoretic terms and study them across all relevant time scales, including the nonequilibrium steady state regime and the final stage of global thermalization. We find that the entropy production is dominated for most times by microscopic deviations from thermality in the baths and the correlation between (but not inside) the baths. Despite these microscopic deviations from thermality, the temperatures and chemical potentials of the baths thermalize as expected, even though our model is integrable. Importantly, this observation is confirmed for both initially mixed and pure states. We further observe that the bath-bath correlations are quite insensitive to the system-bath coupling strength contrary to intuition. Finally, the system-bath correlation, small in an absolute sense, dominates in a relative sense and displays pure quantum correlations for all studied parameter regimes.","cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph",2023,human

No matter the methods of quantization aware training (QAT) or post-training quantization (PTQ), they all depend on the target bit-widths. When the precision of quantization is adjusted, it is necessary to fine-tune the quantized model or minimize the quantization noise, which brings inconvenience in practical applications. In this work, we propose a method to train a model for all quantization that supports diverse bit-widths (e.g., form 8-bit to 1-bit) to satisfy the online quantization bit-width adjustment. It is hot-swappable that can provide specific quantization strategies for different candidates through multiscale quantization. We use wavelet decomposition and reconstruction to increase the diversity of weights, thus significantly improving the performance of each quantization candidate, especially at ultra-low bit-widths (e.g., 3-bit, 2-bit, and 1-bit). Experimental results on ImageNet and COCO show that our method can achieve accuracy comparable performance to dedicated models trained at the same precision.",cs.CV,2021,human

However, we identify a phenomenon we term underthinking, where o1-like LLMs frequently switch between different reasoning thoughts without sufficiently exploring promising paths to reach a correct solution. This behavior leads to inadequate depth of reasoning and decreased performance, particularly on challenging mathematical problems. To systematically analyze this issue, we conduct experiments on three challenging test sets and two representative open-source o1-like models, revealing that frequent thought switching correlates with incorrect responses. We introduce a novel metric to quantify underthinking by measuring token efficiency in incorrect answers. To address underthinking, we propose a decoding strategy with thought switching penalty TIP that discourages premature transitions between thoughts, encouraging deeper exploration of each reasoning path. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves accuracy across challenging datasets without requiring model fine-tuning. Our findings contribute to understanding reasoning inefficiencies in o1-like LLMs and offer a practical solution to enhance their problem-solving capabilities.",cs.CL,2025,human

This includes both nanomagnetic logic (NML) where information is communicated through magnetic fields of nanomagnets and all-spin logic (ASL) where information is communicated through spin currents. A key feature needed for logic implementation is non-reciprocity, whereby the output is switched according to the input but not the other way around, thus providing directed information transfer. The objective of this paper is to draw attention to possible ASL-based schemes that utilize the physics of spin-torque to build in non-reciprocity similar to transistors that could allow logic implementation without the need for special clocking schemes. We use an experimentally benchmarked coupled spin-transport/ magnetization-dynamics model to show that a suitably engineered single ASL unit indeed switches in a non-reciprocal manner. We then present heuristic arguments explaining the origin of this directed information transfer.

These singularities originate from integrals of double total derivatives and determine all contributions to the $β$-function starting from the two-loop approximation. Their sum is expressed in terms of the anomalous dimensions of the quantum gauge superfield, of the Faddeev--Popov ghosts, and of the matter superfields. This allows obtaining the NSVZ equation in the form of a relation between the $β$-function and these anomalous dimensions for the renormalization group functions defined in terms of the bare couplings. It holds for an arbitrary renormalization prescription supplementing the higher covariant derivative regularization. For the renormalization group functions defined in terms of the renormalized couplings we prove that in all loops one of the NSVZ schemes is given by the HD+MSL prescription.",hep-th,2020,human

We introduce an efficient method which predicts reflection responses at the earth's surface for different target-zone scenarios, from a single reflection response at the surface and a model of the changing target zone. The proposed process consists of two main steps. In the first step, the response of the original target zone is removed from the reflection response, using the Marchenko method. In the second step, the modelled response of a new target zone is inserted between the overburden and underburden responses. The method fully accounts for all orders of multiple scattering and, in the elastodynamic case, for wave conversion. For monitoring purposes, only the second step needs to be repeated for each target-zone model. Since the target zone covers only a small part of the entire medium, the proposed method is much more efficient than repeated modelling of the entire reflection response.",physics.geo-ph,2017,human

In this paper, we develop a general technique involving arithmetic of finite fields and algebraic curves over finite fields to determine the covering radius of all generalized Zetterberg codes for $q_0^s \equiv 7 \pmod{8}$, which therefore solves this open problem. We also introduce the concept of twisted half generalized Zetterberg codes of length $\frac{q_0^s+1}{2}$, and show the same results hold for them. As a result, we obtain some quasi-perfect codes.",cs.IT,2024,human

At large coupling, this representation is equivalent to the Kogut-Susskind electric representation, which is known to provide a good description in this region. At small coupling, our approach adjusts the maximum magnetic field that is represented in the digitization as in this regime the low-lying eigenstates become strongly peaked around zero magnetic field. Additionally, we choose a representation of the electric component of the Hamiltonian that gives minimal violation of the canonical commutation relation when acting upon low-lying eigenstates, motivated by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. For (2+1) dimensions with 4 lattice sites the expectation value of the plaquette operator can be calculated with only 7 states per lattice site with per-mille level accuracy for all values of the coupling constant.","hep-ph,hep-lat,quant-ph",2021,human

The evidence cited is based largely on observations of galaxies which do not look anything like our own and on numerical simulations which use ad hoc initial conditions. Given what we believe to be a ``reasonable doubt'' concerning the shape of dark Galactic halo we calculate the optical depth and event rate for microlensing of stars in the LMC assuming a wide range of models that include both prolate and oblate halos. We find, in agreement with previous analysis, that the optical depth for a spherical (E0) halo and for an oblate (E6) halo are roughly the same, essentially because two competing effects cancel approximately. However the optical depth for an E6 prolate halo is reduced by ~35%. This means that an all-Macho prolate halo with reasonable parameters for the Galaxy is consistent with the published microlensing event rate.",astro-ph,1995,human

However, previous safety benchmarks only concern the safety in one language, e.g. the majority language in the pretraining data such as English. In this work, we build the first multilingual safety benchmark for LLMs, XSafety, in response to the global deployment of LLMs in practice. XSafety covers 14 kinds of commonly used safety issues across 10 languages that span several language families. We utilize XSafety to empirically study the multilingual safety for 4 widely-used LLMs, including both close-API and open-source models. Experimental results show that all LLMs produce significantly more unsafe responses for non-English queries than English ones, indicating the necessity of developing safety alignment for non-English languages. In addition, we propose several simple and effective prompting methods to improve the multilingual safety of ChatGPT by evoking safety knowledge and improving cross-lingual generalization of safety alignment. Our prompting method can significantly reduce the ratio of unsafe responses from 19.1% to 9.7% for non-English queries.

It exhibits a 200-ps switching window, 120:1 contrast, 1.5-dB loss, and induces no measurable degradation in the switched photons' entangled-state fidelity (< 0.002). As a proof-of-principle demonstration of its capability, we use the switch to demultiplex a single quantum channel from a dual-channel, time-division-multiplexed entangled photon stream. Furthermore, because this type of switch couples the temporal and spatial degrees of freedom, it provides an important new tool with which to encode multiple-qubit quantum states on a single photon.",quant-ph,2011,human

At pump-probe coincidence, we investigate the behavior the differential reflectivity at the blue edge of the stopband for a wide range of pump- and probe frequencies. Both dispersive and absorptive features are observed from the probe spectra at coincidence. As the pump frequency is tuned through half the electronic bandgap of Si, the magnitude of both these features increases. For the first time we unambiguously identify this dispersive effect with the electronic Kerr effect in photonic crystals, and attribute the the absorptive features to nondegenerate two photon absorption.

We utilize a recently introduced 3D anomaly detection dataset to evaluate whether or not using 3D information is a lost opportunity. First, we present a surprising finding: standard color-only methods outperform all current methods that are explicitly designed to exploit 3D information. This is counter-intuitive as even a simple inspection of the dataset shows that color-only methods are insufficient for images containing geometric anomalies. This motivates the question: how can anomaly detection methods effectively use 3D information? We investigate a range of shape representations including hand-crafted and deep-learning-based; we demonstrate that rotation invariance plays the leading role in the performance. We uncover a simple 3D-only method that beats all recent approaches while not using deep learning, external pre-training datasets, or color information. As the 3D-only method cannot detect color and texture anomalies, we combine it with color-based features, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art.

Theoretically we show that in the long-time limit this multi-agent reinforcement learning process always eventually results in indefinite contribution to the public good or indefinite defection (no agent contributing to the public good). However, by simulation of the pre-limit behavior, we see that on complex network structures there may be mixed states in which the process seems to stabilize before actual convergence to states in which agent beliefs and actions are all the same. In these metastable states the local network characteristics can determine whether agents have high or low trust in their neighbors. More generally it is found that more dense networks result in lower rates of contribution to the public good. This has implications for how one can spread global contribution toward a public good by enabling smaller local interactions.","cs.GT,physics.soc-ph",2024,human

Within a 70-degree zenith angle, the calibration deviation of the images is less than 0.25pixels. Beyond this angle, the calibration deviation increases significantly due to the sparser distribution of stars. Increasing the number of stars with zenith angles greater than 70degrees used for calibration can improve the calibration accuracy for areas beyond the 70-degree zenith angle, reducing the calibration deviation at an 85-degree zenith angle to 0.2pixels.

First, the Earth tectonics is generally a consequence of the springtide-induced magnification of mechanical resonance in the Earth mantle. The same mechanism that causes bridges to collapse under the soldiers step-marching makes also the Earth lithosphere fail under the springtide-induced magnification of the mantle resonance resulting in strong earthquakes. Secondly, by generalizing the above finding onto any body anywhere in all the Universes and at all times, I find that there is no distinction between physics at intergalactic, Newtonian, quantum, and smaller scales. Thus, the so-called constant of proportionality of physics, G, is not a constant but a parameter of a most general form: G = s e^2, nonlinearly varying amongst different scales s. Any scale-related variations of physics, erroneously recognized as such by Einstein and Planck, are only apparent and arise as a consequence of the Earth mantle springtide-induced extreme resonance, which is also critically impeding any terrestrial experiments aimed at estimating the final proportionality G.

When computed at fixed order in perturbation theory, this process exhibits large logarithmic enhancements which must be resummed to all orders when the wall velocity is large. We perform this resummation both analytically and numerically at leading logarithmic accuracy. The numerical simulation is achieved by means of a particle shower in the broken phase of the electroweak theory. The two approaches agree to the 10\% level.

In this paper, we classify all possible input-output transformations that map a system with given shortage of passivity to a system with prescribed excess of passivity. We do so by using the connection between passivity theory and cones for SISO systems, and using the S-lemma for MIMO systems. We also present several possible applications of our results, including simultaneous passivation of multiple systems or with respect to multiple equilibria, as well as optimization problems such as $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain minimization.

Besides, we study the peakedness properties of this family of coherent states, including the peakedness of the wave functions of this family of coherent states in holonomy, momentum and phase space representations. It turns out that the peakedness in these various representations and the (relative) uncertainty of the expectation values of the operators are well controlled by the semi-classical parameter $t$.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05357v1,Fitting Power-laws in empirical data with estimators that work for all exponents,"It has been repeatedly stated that maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of exponents of power-law distributions can only be reliably obtained for exponents smaller than minus one. The main argument that power laws are otherwise not normalizable, depends on the underlying sample space the data is drawn from, and is true only for sample spaces that are unbounded from above. Here we show that power-laws obtained from bounded sample spaces (as is the case for practically all data related problems) are always free of such limitations and maximum likelihood estimates can be obtained for arbitrary powers without restrictions. Here we first derive the appropriate ML estimator for arbitrary exponents of power-law distributions on bounded discrete sample spaces. We then show that an almost identical estimator also works perfectly for continuous data. We implemented this ML estimator and discuss its performance with previous attempts. We present a general recipe of how to use these estimators and present the associated computer codes.","physics.data-an,physics.soc-ph",2016,human

However, knowledge conflicts caused by internal inconsistencies or noisy retrieved content can severely undermine the generation reliability of RAG systems.In this work, we argue that LLMs should rethink all evidence, including both retrieved content and internal knowledge, before generating responses.We propose CARE-RAG (Conflict-Aware and Reliable Evidence for RAG), a novel framework that improves trustworthiness through Conflict-Driven Summarization of all available evidence.CARE-RAG first derives parameter-aware evidence by comparing parameter records to identify diverse internal perspectives. It then refines retrieved evidences to produce context-aware evidence, removing irrelevant or misleading content. To detect and summarize conflicts, we distill a 3B LLaMA3.2 model to perform conflict-driven summarization, enabling reliable synthesis across multiple sources.To further ensure evaluation integrity, we introduce a QA Repair step to correct outdated or ambiguous benchmark answers.Experiments on revised QA datasets with retrieval data show that CARE-RAG consistently outperforms strong RAG baselines, especially in scenarios with noisy or conflicting evidence.","cs.CL,cs.AI",2025,human

They do not suffer from absorption but promise to provide control on the properties of light comparable to plasmonic nanoparticles. To further advance the field, it is important to identify versatile dielectric nanoparticles with unconventional properties. Here, we show that breaking the symmetry of an all-dielectric nanoparticle leads to a geometrically tunable magneto-electric coupling, i.e. an omega-type bianisotropy. The suggested nanoparticle exhibits different backscatterings and, as an interesting consequence, different optical scattering forces for opposite illumination directions. An array of such nanoparticles provides different reflection phases when illuminated from opposite directions. With a proper geometrical tuning, this bianisotropic nanoparticle is capable of providing a $2π$ phase change in the reflection spectrum while possessing a rather large and constant amplitude. This allows creating reflectarrays with near-perfect transmission out of the resonance band due to the absence of an usually employed metallic screen.",physics.optics,2015,human

Time-radial-symmetric metrics,"Primordial black holes (PBHs) are usually assumed to be described by the Schwarzschild or Kerr metrics, which however feature unwelcome singularities. We study the possibility that PBHs are non-singular objects, considering three phenomenological, regular tr (time-radial)-symmetric space-times (including the well-known Bardeen and Hayward ones), featuring either de Sitter or Minkowski cores. We characterize the evaporation of these PBHs and constrain their abundance from $γ$-ray observations. For all three metrics we find that constraints on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs, weaken with respect to the Schwarzschild limits, because of modifications to the PBH temperature and greybody factors. This moves the lower edge of the asteroid mass window down by potentially an order of magnitude or more, leading to a much larger region of parameter space where PBHs can make up all the DM. A companion paper is devoted to non-\textit{tr}-symmetric metrics, including loop quantum gravity-inspired ones. Our work provides a proof-of-principle for the interface between the DM and singularity problems being a promising arena with a rich phenomenology.","gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,hep-ph,hep-th",2024,human

We extensively investigate key design choices for FP4, including block sizes, scaling formats, and rounding methods. Our analysis shows that the NVFP4 format, where each block of 16 FP4 values (E2M1) shares a scale represented in E4M3, provides optimal results. We use stochastic rounding for backward and update passes and round-to-nearest for the forward pass to enhance stability. Additionally, we identify a theoretical and empirical threshold for effective quantized training: when the gradient norm falls below approximately $\sqrt{3}$ times the quantization noise, quantized training becomes less effective. Leveraging these insights, we successfully train a 7-billion-parameter model on 256 Intel Gaudi2 accelerators. The resulting FP4-trained model achieves downstream task performance comparable to a standard BF16 baseline, confirming that FP4 training is a practical and highly efficient approach for large-scale LLM training.

Recent approaches therefore prefer customization, gathering multi-dimensional feedback, and creating distinct reward models for each dimension. Different language models are then optimized for various preferences using multi-objective RLHF (MORLHF) with varying reward weights. However, RL fine-tuning is unstable and resource-heavy, especially with diverse and usually conflicting objectives. In this paper, we present Multi-Objective Direct Preference Optimization (MODPO), an RL-free extension of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for multiple alignment objectives. Essentially, MODPO folds language modeling directly into reward modeling, training language models as implicit collective reward models that combine all objectives with specific weights. MODPO theoretically yields the same optimal solutions as MORLHF but is practically more stable and efficient. Empirical results in safety alignment and long-form question answering show that MODPO matches or outperforms existing methods, producing a Pareto front of language models catering to diverse preferences with three times less computational resources compared to MORLHF.

Despite the Kerr effect`s ultrafast response, its inherently weak nonlinearity has hindered practical applications. Here, we explore free-electron-induced Kerr nonlinearities in all-semiconductor waveguides, revealing that longitudinal bulk plasmons (inherently nonlocal excitations) can generate exceptionally strong Kerr nonlinearities. We specifically develop a nonlinear eigenmode analysis integrated with semiclassical hydrodynamic theory to compute the linear and nonlinear optical responses originating from the quantum behavior of free electrons in heavily doped semiconductors. These waveguides achieve ultrahigh nonlinear coefficients exceeding 10$^7$ W$^{-1}$km$^{-1}$ and support long-propagating modes with propagation distances over 100 $μ$m. Additionally, we confirm the robustness of the nonlinear response under realistic conditions by considering viscoelastic and nonlinear damping mechanisms. Finally, we implement our all-semiconductor waveguides in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, demonstrating efficient nonlinear modulation of the transmittance spectrum via the free-electron Kerr effect. This work evidences the transformative potential of free-electron nonlinearities in heavily doped semiconductors for photonic integrated circuits, paving the way for scalable on-chip nonlinear nanophotonic systems.","physics.optics,quant-ph",2025,human

All accelerated versions of the algorithm are aimed at minimizing the running time required to produce a stochastic trajectory in state space. In these simulations, a necessary condition for reliable statistics is averaging over a large number of simulations.

The proof goes by extending the polynomial method from Boolean functions to quantum state generation problems. In the process, the bound is even strengthened. We then show that this extended polynomial method is a special case of the multiplicative adversary method with an adversary matrix that is independent of the function. This new result therefore provides insight on the reason why in some cases the adversary method is stronger than the polynomial method. It also reveals a clear picture of the relation between the different lower bound techniques, as it implies that all known techniques reduce to the multiplicative adversary method.","quant-ph,cs.CC",2012,human

This implies constraints on the possible sequences of body motion, which have to be nonreciprocal. Furthermore, the presence of a strong drag limits the range of resulting velocities. Here, we propose a swimming mechanism, which uses the buckling instability triggered by pressure waves to propel a spherical, hollow shell. With a macroscopic experimental model, we show that a net displacement is produced at all $Re$ regimes. An optimal displacement caused by non-trivial history effects is reached at intermediate $Re$. We show that, due to the fast activation induced by the instability, this regime is reachable by microscopic shells. The rapid dynamics would also allow high frequency excitation with standard traveling ultrasonic waves. Scale considerations predict a swimming velocity of order 1 cm/s for a remote-controlled microrobot, a suitable value for biological applications such as drug delivery.","physics.flu-dyn,cond-mat.soft",2017,human

However, low-rank model training necessitates adjusting several additional factorization hyperparameters, such as the rank of the factorization at each layer. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by introducing Cuttlefish, an automated low-rank training approach that eliminates the need for tuning factorization hyperparameters. Cuttlefish leverages the observation that after a few epochs of full-rank training, the stable rank (i.e., an approximation of the true rank) of each layer stabilizes at a constant value. Cuttlefish switches from full-rank to low-rank training once the stable ranks of all layers have converged, setting the dimension of each factorization to its corresponding stable rank. Our results show that Cuttlefish generates models up to 5.6 times smaller than full-rank models, and attains up to a 1.2 times faster end-to-end training process while preserving comparable accuracy. Moreover, Cuttlefish outperforms state-of-the-art low-rank model training methods and other prominent baselines.

Using two ultrashort magnetic field steps with variable time delay we control the induction decay in yttrium iron garnet (YIG). By setting suitable delay times between the two steps the precession of the magnetization can either be enhanced or completely stopped. The method allows for a determination of the precession frequency within a few precession periods and with an accuracy much higher than can be achieved using fast fourier transformation. Moreover it holds the promise to massively increase precession amplitudes in pulsed inductive microwave magnetometry (PIMM) using low amplitude finite pulse trains.

http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0211301v1,Unification Model of Seyfert Galaxies: Are All Seyfert 2 Galaxies Created Equal?,"Based on the analysis of a large spectropolarimetric survey of Seyfert 2 galaxies (S2s) from the CfA and 12-micron samples conducted mostly at Lick and Palomar Observatories, it is shown that S2s with hidden BLR (HBLRs) are intrinsically more powerful than non-HBLR S2s. The positive detection of BLR in HBLR S2s appears to be due largely to the intrinsic strength of the hidden AGN nucleus rather than the lower level of nuclear obscuration or reduced dominance of circumnuclear starburst. The HBLR S2s, on average, share many similar large-scale characteristics with Seyfert 1 galaxies (S1s), as would be expected if the unified model is correct, while the non-HBLR S2s generally do not. These results strongly suggest that not all S2s are intrinsically similar in nature, and the HBLR S2s may be the only true counterparts to normal S1s.",astro-ph,2002,human

Depending on their deformation properties, elliptic and hyperbolic LCSs have been identified from different variational principles, solving different equations. Here we observe that, in three dimensions, initial positions of all variational LCSs are invariant manifolds of the same autonomous dynamical system, generated by the intermediate eigenvector field, $ξ_{2}(x_{0})$, of the Cauchy-Green strain tensor. This $ξ_{2}$-system allows for the detection of LCSs in any unsteady flow by classic methods, such as Poincaré maps, developed for autonomous dynamical systems. As examples, we consider both steady and time-aperiodic flows, and use their dual $ξ_{2}$-system to uncover both hyperbolic and elliptic LCSs from a single computation.","math.DS,nlin.CD,physics.flu-dyn",2016,human

We compare the resulting model, dubbed TavBERT, against contemporary PLMs based on subwords for three highly complex and ambiguous MRLs (Hebrew, Turkish, and Arabic), testing them on both morphological and semantic tasks. Our results show, for all tested languages, that while TavBERT obtains mild improvements on surface-level tasks à la POS tagging and full morphological disambiguation, subword-based PLMs achieve significantly higher performance on semantic tasks, such as named entity recognition and extractive question answering.

We obtain the recursive relations that allow one to get the leading and subleading divergences in all loops in a pure algebraic way staring from the one loop (for the leading poles) and two loop (for the subleading ones) diagrams. As a particular example where the recursive relations have a simple form we consider the ladder type diagrams.

Mathematically, this phase-locking effect is captured by the Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) model, an important example of a nonlinear dynamical system. The standard RSJ model considers an overdamped JJ with a sinusoidal (single-harmonic) current-phase relation (CPR) in the current-driven regime with a monochromatic ac component. While this model predicts only integer Shapiro steps, the inclusion of higher Josephson harmonics is known to generate fractional Shapiro steps. In this paper, we show that only two Josephson harmonics in the CPR are sufficient to produce all possible fractional Shapiro steps within the RSJ framework. Using perturbative methods, we analyze the amplitudes of these fractional steps. Furthermore, by introducing a phase shift between the two Josephson harmonics, we reveal an asymmetry between positive and negative fractional steps - a signature of the Josephson diode effect.","cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.mes-hall,math-ph,math.DS",2025,human

To this end, I attempt to close a gap in the literature by first deriving, strictly within classical field theory, the real-time electromagnetic dipole and gravitational quadrupole energy and angular momentum radiation formulas in all relevant dimensions. The even dimensional case, where massless signals travel strictly on the null cone, depends on the time derivatives of the dipoles and quadrupoles solely at retarded time; whereas the odd dimensional ones involve an integral over their retarded histories. Despite the propagation of light inside the null cone, however, I argue that a monochromatic light bulb of some intrinsic duration in odd dimensions remains approximately the same apparent duration to a distant detector, though the tail effect does produce a phase shift and adds to the signal several transitory non-oscillatory inverse square roots in time.","gr-qc,hep-th",2021,human

This regime in fact covers the whole range of rapidities at which JIMWLK evolution is supposed to be applicable. We derive the RG equation that resums these logarithms to all orders in alpha_s in the JIMWLK Hamiltonian. This is a nonlinear equation for the eikonal scattering matrix S(x).

http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09168v2,Towards Probing the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background in All Flavors,"Fully understanding the average core-collapse supernova requires detecting the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) in all flavors. While the DSNB $\barν_e$ flux is near detection, and the DSNB $ν_e$ flux has a good upper limit and prospects for improvement, the DSNB $ν_x$ (each of $ν_μ, ν_τ, \barν_μ, \barν_τ$) flux has a poor limit and heretofore had no clear path for improved sensitivity. We show that a succession of xenon-based dark matter detectors -- XENON1T (completed), XENONnT/LUX-ZEPLIN (running), and DARWIN (proposed) -- can dramatically improve sensitivity to DSNB $ν_x$ the neutrino-nucleus coherent scattering channel. XENON1T could match the present sensitivity of $\sim 10^3 \; \mathrm{cm}^{-2}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ per $ν_x$ flavor, XENONnT/LUX-ZEPLIN would have linear improvement of sensitivity with exposure, and a long run of DARWIN could reach a flux sensitivity of $\sim 10 \; \mathrm{cm}^{-2}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Together, these would also contribute to greatly improve bounds on non-standard scenarios. Ultimately, to reach the standard flux range of $\sim 1 \; \mathrm{cm}^{-2}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, even larger exposures will be needed, which we show may be possible with the series of proposed lead-based RES-NOVA detectors.","astro-ph.HE,hep-ph",2021,human

This computational method is based on operational matrices and vectors. The operational vector for hybrid block pulse functions and Chebyshev polynomials is constructed. The scheme transforms the integral equation to a matrix equation and solves it with a careful estimate of the error involved. The main characteristic of the scheme is the low cost of setting up the equations without using any projection method which is the consequence of using operational vectors. Simple structure to implement, low computational cost and perfect approximate solutions are the major points of the presented method.   Error analysis and comparisons with other existing schemes demonstrate the efficiency and the superiority of our scheme.",math.NA,2018,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03132v3,"All three-angle variants of Tsirelson's precession protocol, and improved bounds for wedge integrals of Wigner functions","Tsirelson's precession protocol is a nonclassicality witness that can be defined for both discrete and continuous variable systems. Its original version involves measuring a precessing observable, like the quadrature of a harmonic oscillator or a component of angular momentum, along three equally-spaced angles. In this work, we characterise all three-angle variants of this protocol. For continuous variables, we show that the maximum score $\mathbf{P}_3^\infty$ achievable by the quantum harmonic oscillator is the same for all such generalised protocols. We also derive markedly tighter bounds for $\mathbf{P}_3^\infty$, both rigorous and conjectured, which translate into improved bounds on the amount of negativity a Wigner function can have in certain wedge-shaped regions of phase space. For discrete variables, we show that changing the angles significantly improves the score for most spin systems. Like the original protocol, these generalised variants can detect non-Gaussian and genuine multipartite entanglement when applied on composite systems. Overall, this work broadens the scope of Tsirelson's original protocol, making it capable to detect the nonclassicality and entanglement of many more states.",quant-ph,2024,human

I then analyze the Sudakov limit of the distribution and the fragmentation functions using Wilson lines and prove that the corresponding Sudakov exponents in the non-Abelian theory are the same to any logarithmic accuracy. The anomalous dimension is then determined to two-loop order, corresponding to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy in the exponent, in two ways: the first by extracting the singular terms from a recent calculation of the fragmentation function and the second by performing the two-loop Wilson-line calculation in configuration space.

However, simultaneous achievement of ultralow power consumption, broad bandwidth and high extinction ratio remains challenging. We experimentally demonstrate an ultralow-power all-optical switching by exploiting chiral interaction between light and optically active material in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). We achieve switching extinction ratio of 20.0(3.8) and 14.7(2.8) dB with power cost of 66.1(0.7) and 1.3(0.1) fJ/bit, respectively. The bandwidth of our all-optical switching is about 4.2 GHz. Our theoretical analysis shows that the switching bandwidth can, in principle, exceed 110 GHz. Moreover, the switching has the potential to be operated at few-photon level. Our all-optical switching exploits a chiral MZI made of linear optical components. It excludes the requisite of high-quality optical cavity or large optical nonlinearity, thus greatly simplifying realization.

The pseudogap opens around the ($π$,0) antinodes below a temperature $T^*$ leaving Fermi arcs across the remnant Fermi surface\cite{Kanigel} on which the superconducting gap forms at $T_c$. One thing that seems agreed is that the ratio $2Δ_0/k_BT_c$ well exceeds the BCS value and grows with underdoping\cite{Miyakawa1,Miyakawa2}, suggesting unconventional, non-BCS superconductivity. Here we re-examine data from many spectroscopies, especially Raman $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ scattering\cite{Sacuto,Guyard}, and reconcile them all within a two-gap scenario showing that the points of disagreement are an artefact of spectral-weight loss arising from the pseudogap.

However, existing rigorous protocols either require deep quantum circuits or exponentially many single-qubit measurements. In this work, we prove that almost all n-qubit target states, including those with exponential circuit complexity, can be certified from only O(n^2) single-qubit measurements. This result is established by a new technique that relates certification to the mixing time of a random walk. Our protocol has applications for benchmarking quantum systems, for optimizing quantum circuits to generate a desired target state, and for learning and verifying neural networks, tensor networks, and various other representations of quantum states using only single-qubit measurements. We show that such verified representations can be used to efficiently predict highly non-local properties that would otherwise require an exponential number of measurements. We demonstrate these applications in numerical experiments with up to 120 qubits, and observe advantage over existing methods such as cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB).","quant-ph,cs.IT,cs.LG",2024,human

Most existing dataset distillation methods assume that all real instances contribute equally to the process. In practice, real-world datasets contain both informative and redundant or even harmful instances, and directly distilling the full dataset without considering data quality can degrade model performance. In this work, we present Influence-Weighted Distillation IWD, a principled framework that leverages influence functions to explicitly account for data quality in the distillation process. IWD assigns adaptive weights to each instance based on its estimated impact on the distillation objective, prioritizing beneficial data while downweighting less useful or harmful ones. Owing to its modular design, IWD can be seamlessly integrated into diverse dataset distillation frameworks. Our empirical results suggest that integrating IWD tends to improve the quality of distilled datasets and enhance model performance, with accuracy gains of up to 7.8%.","cs.LG,cs.AI",2025,human

We provide an intuition for why sufficiently high entropy regularization ensures that different random seed produce joint policies which are mutually compatible. We also empirically find that a high $λ_{\text{GAE}}$ around 0.9, and using RNNs instead of just feed-forward layers in the actor-critic architecture, strongly increase inter-seed cross-play. While these results demonstrate the dramatic effect that hyperparameters can have not just on self-play scores but also on cross-play scores, we show that there are simple Dec-POMDPs though, in which standard policy gradient methods with increased entropy regularization are not able to achieve perfect inter-seed cross-play, thus demonstrating the continuing necessity for new algorithms for zero-shot coordination.","cs.LG,cs.MA",2025,human

The scheme delivers results that are largely independent of both the value of the hadron scale and the pointwise form of the charge; and, inter alia, enables derivation of a model-independent identity that relates the strength of the proton's gluon helicity DF, $ΔG_p^ζ$, to that of the analogous singlet polarised quark DF and valence quark momentum fraction. Using available data fits and theory predictions, the identity yields $ΔG_p(ζ_{\rm C}=\surd 3{\rm GeV})=1.48(10)$.

We find that, when the auxiliary SU(2) gauge field strength vanishes, the most general supersymmetric configuration preserving four supercharges is labelled by n_v+1 real parameters corresponding to the excitations of the conformal mode of the graviton and the scalars of the n_v vector multiplets. In the general case, the localization manifold is labelled by an additional SU(2) triplet of one-forms and a scalar function.",hep-th,2012,human

A folklore generalization of Nash-Williams' Conjecture extends this to all $q\ge 4$ by positing that every $K_q$-divisible graph on $n$ vertices (for $n$ large enough) with minimum degree at least $\left(1-\frac{1}{q+1}\right)n$ has a $K_q$-decomposition. We disprove this conjecture for all $q\ge 4$; namely, we show that for each $q\ge 4$, there exists $c > 1$ such that there exist infinitely many $K_q$-divisible graphs $G$ with minimum degree at least $\left(1-\frac{1}{c\cdot(q+1)}\right)v(G)$ and no $K_q$-decomposition; indeed we construct them admitting no fractional $K_q$-decomposition thus disproving the fractional relaxation of this conjecture. Our result also disproves the more general partite version. Indeed, we even show the folklore conjecture is off by a multiplicative factor by showing that for every $\varepsilon > 0$ and every large enough integer $q$, there exist infinitely many $K_q$-divisible graphs $G$ with minimum degree at least $\bigg(1-\frac{1}{\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{2}-\varepsilon\right)\cdot (q+1)}\bigg)v(G)$ with no (fractional) $K_q$-decomposition.",math.CO,2025,human

We derived the generalised RG equation for the effective potential in the leading logarithmic approximation and applied it to evaluate the potentials of the $T^2$ and $T^4$-models, which are often used in modern models of slow-roll inflation. We found that while the one-loop correction strongly affects the potential, breaking its original symmetry, the contribution of higher loops smoothes the behaviour of the potential. However, unlike the $φ^4$-case, we found that the effective potentials preserve spontaneous symmetry breaking when summing all the leading corrections. We calculated the spectral indices $n_s$ and $r$ for the effective potentials of both models and found that they are consistent with the observational data for a wide range of parameters of the models.","hep-th,gr-qc",2023,human

Here we extend it to general AdS$_3 \times S^3$ correlators which contain also the chiral primary operators of spin zero and one that sit in the gravity multiplet. The key observation is that the 6D conformal primary field associated with these operators is not a scalar but a self-dual $3$-form primary. As an example, we focus on the correlators involving two fields in the tensor multiplets and two in the gravity multiplet and show that all such correlators are encoded in a conformal 6D correlator between two scalars and two self-dual $3$-forms, which is determined by three functions of the cross ratios.

To better reconcile features between heterogeneous VFMs and the stereo matching model and fully exploit prior knowledge from VFMs, we proposed a dual-level feature utilization mechanism that aligns heterogeneous features and transfers multi-level knowledge. Based on the mechanism, a dual-level selective knowledge transfer module is designed to selectively transfer knowledge and integrate the advantages of multiple VFMs. Experimental results show that AIO-Stereo achieves start-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and ranks $1^{st}$ on the Middlebury dataset and outperforms all the published work on the ETH3D benchmark.",cs.CV,2024,human

For a directed acyclic graph $H$ and an oriented graph $G$, let $f_H(G)$ be the maximum number of pairwise disjoint copies of $H$ that can be found in {\em all} feedback arc sets of $G$. In particular, to make $G$ acyclic, one must remove (or reverse) $f_H(G)$ pairwise disjoint copies of $H$. Most intriguing is the case where $H$ is a $k$-clique, where the parameter is denoted by $f_k(G)$. Determining $f_k(G)$ for arbitrary $G$ seems challenging.

Moreover, using field-driven-SHE-assisted domain wall (DW) motion measurements, both the SHE efficiency in the racetrack is determined and the chirality of the optically written DW's is verified.

Moreover, it is possible to co-design such leaky-wave antenna arrays with surface-wave waveguides that can guide the received power to the load or to another leaky-wave antenna section. That second section can either reradiate the received power into any direction or perform some other transformation of the reradiated wave front, for example, focusing the power at a point. These and other functionalities are realized by global optimization of the reactive loads of array elements. This global optimization, together with the use of arrays with a subwavelength geometrical period, allows proper control over both propagating and evanescent-field distributions, ensuring theoretically perfect performance at arbitrary scan angles.

However, general-purpose object detectors like Faster R-CNN are prone to providing overconfident predictions for outlier objects. Recent outlier-aware object detection approaches estimate the density of instance-wide features with class-conditional Gaussians and train on synthesized outlier features from their low-likelihood regions. However, this strategy does not guarantee that the synthesized outlier features will have a low likelihood according to the other class-conditional Gaussians. We propose a novel outlier-aware object detection framework that distinguishes outliers from inlier objects by learning the joint data distribution of all inlier classes with an invertible normalizing flow. The appropriate sampling of the flow model ensures that the synthesized outliers have a lower likelihood than inliers of all object classes, thereby modeling a better decision boundary between inlier and outlier objects.

Our framework utilizes optimistic purification performed directly on the half-RGS primitives across long distances without waiting for heralding outcomes. The overhead is modest: the RGS generation slows down proportionally with the number of purification rounds, and each round requires only one additional quantum emitter per half-RGS source. However, since the generation time is negligible compared to the end-to-end communication delay, the total latency remains effectively dominated by communication time, similar to frameworks without purification. Our framework enables flexible purification scheduling along the connection path, making it compatible with memory-based strategies, a rich body of research on purification scheduling and optimization that was previously thought inapplicable to the RGS scheme.

Its generation seems therefore explainable only by the local action of gauge-dependent potentials, not of gauge-independent fields. This was recently challenged by Vaidman, who explained the phase by the solenoid's current interacting with the electron's field (at the solenoid). Still, his model has a residual non-locality: it does not explain how the phase, generated at the solenoid, is detectable on the charge. In this paper we solve this non-locality explicitly, by quantising the field.

This paper presents different approaches, namely, general method and optimal method which facilitate to compare the results and draw the optimal solution. The method adopted is to know the number of symbols evaluated in each logic, construct better approaches based on heuristics, proposals and implementations of human sequential development using Rapid algorithmic prototyping tool for ordered reasoning (RAPTOR). In traditional approach, task is complex in point of time and space; however, this method reduces these prime factors by applying simple mathematical theorems and heuristics.

Creating a new architecture from the ground up requires substantial scientific expertise and creativity, often spanning years or even decades. In this study, we propose an alternative approach called ""Differentiable Microscopy,"" which introduces a top-down design paradigm for optical microscopes. Using all-optical phase retrieval as an illustrative example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of data-driven microscopy design through $\partialμ$. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive comparisons with competing methods, showcasing the consistent superiority of our learned designs across multiple datasets, including biological samples. To substantiate our ideas, we experimentally validate the functionality of one of the learned designs, providing a proof of concept. The proposed differentiable microscopy framework supplements the creative process of designing new optical systems and would perhaps lead to unconventional but better optical designs.","physics.optics,cs.CV,physics.comp-ph",2022,human

A major breakthrough in this direction was achieved in [7], where it was shown that, under certain natural conditions on the algebra $\mathcal{D}(W)$, all solutions arise from Darboux transformations of direct sums of classical scalar weights. In this paper, we study a new $3 \times 3$ Hermite-type weight matrix and determine its algebra $\mathcal{D}(W)$ as a $\mathbb{C}[D_1]$-module generated by $\{I, D_2\}$, where $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ are second-order differential operators. This complete description of the algebra allows us to prove that the weight does not arise from a Darboux transformation of classical scalar weights, showing that it falls outside the classification theorem of [7]. Unlike previous examples in [3,4], which also do not fit within this classification, the algebra $\mathcal{D}(W)$ of this weight matrix is not generated by a single differential operator $D$, making it a fundamentally different case. These results complement the classification theorem of the Matrix Bochner Problem by providing a new type of singular example.",math.CA,2025,human

While many flare prediction studies do not address this problem directly, all-clear predictions can be useful in operational context. However, in all-clear predictions, finding the right balance between avoiding false negatives (misses) and reducing the false positives (false alarms) is often challenging. Our study focuses on training and testing a set of interval-based time series classifiers named Time Series Forest (TSF). These classifiers will be used towards building an all-clear flare prediction system by utilizing multivariate time series data. Throughout this paper, we demonstrate our data collection, predictive model building and evaluation processes, and compare our time series classification models with baselines using our benchmark datasets. Our results show that time series classifiers provide better forecasting results in terms of skill scores, precision and recall metrics, and they can be further improved for more precise all-clear forecasts by tuning model hyperparameters.",cs.LG,2021,human

Another proof of this quantization statement was later obtained in a joint paper by Yu.S.Ilyashenko, D.A.Filimonov, D.A.Ryzhov. This implies the similar quantization effect for every $v(x)=a\sin(mx)+b\cos(mx)+c$ and rotation numbers that are multiples of $\frac 1m$. We show that for every other analytic vector field $v(x)$ (i.e., having at least two Fourier harmonics with non-zero non-opposite degrees and nonzero coefficients) there exists an analytic periodic function $f(t)$ such that the corresponding family of equations has phase-lock areas for all the rational values of the rotation number.",math.DS,2015,human

However, their performance deteriorates significantly when tested in degrading weather conditions. In addition, even when adapted to perform robustly in a sequence of different weather conditions, they are often unable to perform well in all of them and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To efficiently mitigate forgetting, we propose Domain-Incremental Learning through Activation Matching (DILAM), which employs unsupervised feature alignment to adapt only the affine parameters of a clear weather pre-trained network to different weather conditions. We propose to store these affine parameters as a memory bank for each weather condition and plug-in their weather-specific parameters during driving (i.e. test time) when the respective weather conditions are encountered. Our memory bank is extremely lightweight, since affine parameters account for less than 2% of a typical object detector. Furthermore, contrary to previous domain-incremental learning approaches, we do not require the weather label when testing and propose to automatically infer the weather condition by a majority voting linear classifier.",cs.CV,2023,human

Such events are seen as cosmological gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in other galaxies when their beamed radiation happens to point towards Earth. This source of CRs is located in the Galactic halo. It therefore explains the absence of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min cutoff in the spectrum of the ultra-high energy CRs. The position in energy of the ``ankle'' in the CR energy spectrum is shown to arise in a natural way. Moreover, an origin of lower energy CRs in the Galactic halo naturally accounts for the high degree of isotropy of CRs around 100 TeV from airshower observations, and the small galactocentric gradient of low-energy CRs derived from gamma-ray observations.","astro-ph,hep-ph",1999,human

In this article, we rigorously analyze the prevalence of this property for the mean squared error induced by shallow, 1-hidden layer neural networks with analytic activation functions when applied to regression problems. The parameter space is divided into two domains: the 'efficient domain' (all parameters for which the respective realization function cannot be generated by a network having a smaller number of neurons) and the 'redundant domain' (the remaining parameters). In almost all regression problems on the efficient domain the optimization landscape only features local minima that are strongly convex. Formally, we will show that for certain randomly picked regression problems the optimization landscape is almost surely a Morse function on the efficient domain. The redundant domain has significantly smaller dimension than the efficient domain and on this domain, potential local minima are never isolated.","cs.LG,math.PR,stat.ML",2025,human

Unlike the BHs considered earlier, ZLMY BHs are free from Cauchy horizons, and are hotter than their Schwarzschild counterparts. We show that this higher temperature boosts the evaporation spectra of ZLMY PBHs, tightening limits on their abundance relative to Schwarzschild PBHs and shrinking the asteroid mass window where they can constitute all the DM, a result which reverses the earlier trend, but rests on firmer theoretical ground. While stressing the potential key role of quantum gravity effects in addressing the singularity and DM problems, our study shows that working within a consistent theoretical framework can strongly affect observational predictions.","gr-qc,astro-ph.CO,hep-ph,hep-th",2025,human

We show how the change of the $Z_2$ topological invariant at a band inversion is entirely determined by the irreps of occupied and unoccupied bands at the high-symmetry point. For example, in the case of $C_3$, we show that the $Z_2$ topological invariants change whenever the band inversion occurs between two Kramers pairs whose $C_3$ eigenvalues are $\{e^{πi / 3}, e^{-πi / 3}\}$ and $\{-1, -1\}$.

So far the effective solution of Kohn's problem is known only for special domains ${\rm Re}(z_{n+1})+\sum_{j=1}^N|f_j|^2<0$ in ${\mathbb C}^{n+1}$ with $f_j$ holomorphic in $z_1,...,z_n$, because for such domains it suffices to deal with holomorphic multipliers. One main obstacle to treat the general smooth case is the need to deal with nonholomorphic multipliers. This note introduces a new technique to handle nonholomorphic multipliers occurring in more general domains with $f_j$ holomorphic in all the $n+1$ variables $z_1,...,z_n,z_{n+1}$.",math.CV,2023,human

Here, by exploiting the platform of atomic-cladding wave guides, we experimentally demonstrate the resonant coupling of rubidium vapor and an atomic cladding micro ring resonator. Specifically, we observed cavity-atom coupling in the form of Fano resonances having a distinct dependency on the relative frequency detuning between the photonic and the atomic resonances. Moreover, we were able to significantly enhance the efficiency of all optical switching in the V-type pump-probe scheme. The coupled system of micro-ring resonator and atomic vapor is a promising building block for a variety of light vapor experiments, as it offers a very small footprint, high degree of integration and extremely strong confinement of light and vapor. As such it may be used for important applications, such as all optical switching, dispersion engineering (e.g. slow and fast light) and metrology, as well as for the observation of important effects such as strong coupling, Purcell enhancement and bistability.",physics.optics,2016,human

However, environments with tight resource constraints, changing objectives and intentions, or varied task requirements, could limit the real-world utility of a singular JAT. Hence, in tandem with current trends towards building increasingly large JATs, this paper conducts an initial exploration into concepts underlying the creation of a diverse set of compact machine learning model sets. Composed of many smaller and specialized models, the Set of Sets is formulated to simultaneously fulfil many task settings and environmental conditions. A means to arrive at such a set tractably in one pass of a neuroevolutionary multitasking algorithm is presented for the first time, bringing us closer to models that are collectively Masters of All Trades.",cs.NE,2022,human

Inspired by the structural design of recent multi-modal models, where, regardless of the combination of input modalities, all inputs are ultimately fused into the language space, we aim to explore whether unlearning solely in the textual domain can be effective for cross-modality safety alignment. Our evaluation across six datasets empirically demonstrates the transferability -- textual unlearning in VLMs significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to less than 8\% and in some cases, even as low as nearly 2\% for both text-based and vision-text-based attacks, alongside preserving the utility. Moreover, our experiments show that unlearning with a multi-modal dataset offers no potential benefits but incurs significantly increased computational demands, possibly up to 6 times higher.","cs.CL,cs.CR,cs.LG",2024,human

Firstly, we derive general mathematical criteria which any model for the inputs should obey and then suggest a Resonance Model satisfying those criteria.

The resulting entropy-power uncertainty relation is equivalent to the entropic formulation of the uncertainty relation due to Bialynicki-Birula and Mycielski, but can be further extended to rotated variables. Hence, based on a reasonable assumption, we give a partial proof of a tighter form of the entropy-power uncertainty relation taking correlations into account and provide extensive numerical evidence of its validity.

In particular, we are able to beat Iwaniec's barrier $q<x^{9/20-}$, and improve all the existing inequalities in the range $x^{9/20}\ll q<x^{1/2-}$ by utilizing bilinear or trilinear structures in the remainder terms of linear sieve. The proof is based on various estimates for character and exponential sums, by appealing to arithmetic exponent pairs and bilinear forms with algebraic trace functions from $\ell$-adic cohomology, trilinear forms with Kloosterman fractions, and sums of Kloosterman sums from spectral theory of automorphic forms, as well as large value theorem for Dirichlet polynomials.",math.NT,2024,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08996v2,All-electrical Magnon Transport Experiments in Magnetically Ordered Insulators,"Angular momentum transport is one of the cornerstones of spintronics. Spin angular momentum is not only transported by mobile charge carriers, but also by the quantized excitations of the magnetic lattice in magnetically ordered systems. In this regard, magnetically ordered insulators provide a platform for magnon spin transport experiments without additional contributions from spin currents carried by mobile electrons. In combination with charge-to-spin current conversion processes in conductors with finite spin-orbit coupling it is possible to realize all-electrical magnon transport schemes in thin film heterostructures. This review provides an insight into such experiments and recent breakthroughs achieved. Special attention is given to charge current based manipulation via an adjacent normal metal of magnon transport in magnetically ordered insulators in terms of spin-transfer torque. Moreover, the influence of two magnon modes with opposite spin in antiferromagnetic insulators on all-electrical magnon transport experiments is discussed.",cond-mat.mes-hall,2021,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08173v1,Towards All-in-One Medical Image Re-Identification,"Medical image re-identification (MedReID) is under-explored so far, despite its critical applications in personalized healthcare and privacy protection. In this paper, we introduce a thorough benchmark and a unified model for this problem. First, to handle various medical modalities, we propose a novel Continuous Modality-based Parameter Adapter (ComPA). ComPA condenses medical content into a continuous modality representation and dynamically adjusts the modality-agnostic model with modality-specific parameters at runtime. This allows a single model to adaptively learn and process diverse modality data. Furthermore, we integrate medical priors into our model by aligning it with a bag of pre-trained medical foundation models, in terms of the differential features. Compared to single-image feature, modeling the inter-image difference better fits the re-identification problem, which involves discriminating multiple images. We evaluate the proposed model against 25 foundation models and 8 large multi-modal language models across 11 image datasets, demonstrating consistently superior performance. Additionally, we deploy the proposed MedReID technique to two real-world applications, i.e., history-augmented personalized diagnosis and medical privacy protection.

We have extended the measurements of the field-orientation dependent specific heat to include conical field rotations consisting of in-plane azimuthal angle phi-sweeps at various polar angles theta performed down to 0.1 K. Clear 4-fold oscillations of the specific heat and a rapid suppression of it by changing theta are explained only by a compensation from two types of bands with anti-phase gap anisotropies with each other. The results indicate that the active band, responsible for the superconducting instability, is the gamma-band with the lines of gap minima along the [100] directions, and the passive band is the alpha- and beta-bands with the lines of gap minima or zeros along the [110] directions in their induced superconducting gaps. We also demonstrated the scaling of the specific heat for the field in the c-direction, which supports the line-node-like gap structures running along the kz direction.","cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.str-el",2004,human

However, recognition errors could propagate downstream, potentially impacting the detection decisions. Recent studies have revealed a non-linear relationship between word error rates (WER) and AD detection performance, where ASR transcriptions with notable errors could still yield AD detection accuracy equivalent to that based on manual transcriptions. This work presents a series of analyses to explore the effect of ASR transcription errors in BERT-based AD detection systems. Our investigation reveals that not all ASR errors contribute equally to detection performance. Certain words, such as stopwords, despite constituting a large proportion of errors, are shown to play a limited role in distinguishing AD. In contrast, the keywords related to diagnosis tasks exhibit significantly greater importance relative to other words. These findings provide insights into the interplay between ASR errors and the downstream detection model.","cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.LG,q-bio.NC",2024,human

The switch is cascadable: the device output is capable of driving multiple inputs, and exhibits transistor-like signal-level restoration with both saturated and intermediate response regimes.

Here it is shown that a proper modulation of the masses and the elastic constants makes it possible to obtain a periodic dynamics and a perfect transmission of any kind of pulse between the chain ends, since the initial configuration evolves to its mirror image in the half period. This makes the chain to behave as a Newton's cradle. By a known algorithm based on orthogonal polynomials one can numerically solve the general inverse problem leading from the spectrum to the dynamical matrix and then to the corresponding mass-spring sequence, so yielding all possible ``perfect cradles''. As quantum linear systems obey the same dynamics of their classical counterparts, these results also apply to the quantum case: for instance, a wavefunction localized at one end would evolve to its mirror image at the opposite chain end.","physics.class-ph,quant-ph",2020,human

We explore and adapt a recent deep learning approach -- termed neural-adjoint -- and find it is capable of accurately and efficiently estimating complex geometry needed to yield a targeted frequency-dependent scattering. We also show how the neural-adjoint method can intelligently grow the design search space to include designs that increasingly and accurately approximate the desired scattering response. The neural-adjoint method is not restricted to the case demonstrated and may be applied to plasmonics, photonic bandgap, and other structured material systems.","physics.optics,physics.app-ph",2020,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03788v1,Looking in the axion mirror: An all-sky analysis of stimulated decay,"Axion dark matter (DM) produces echo images of bright radio sources via stimulated decay. These images appear as a faint radio line centered at half the axion mass, with the line width set by the DM velocity dispersion. Due to the kinematics of the decay, the echo can be emitted in the direction nearly opposite to the incoming source of stimulating radiation, meaning that axions effectively behave as imperfect monochromatic mirrors. We present an all-sky analysis of axion DM-induced echo images using extragalactic radio point sources, Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs), and Galactic synchrotron radiation (GSR) as sources of stimulating radiation. The aggregate signal strength is not significantly affected by unknown properties of individual sources of stimulating radiation, which we sample from an empirical distribution to generate an ensemble of realizations for the all-sky signal template. We perform forecasts for CHIME, HERA, CHORD, HIRAX, and BURSTT, finding that they can run as competitive axion experiments simultaneously with other objectives, requiring no new hardware.","hep-ph,astro-ph.GA,astro-ph.HE",2023,human

As the name suggests, the device doesn't require a cavity for lasing other than the nonlinear medium. Here, we report the first demonstration of MOPO under the effect of an all-optical waveguide. The efficient four-wave mixing process due to counter-propagating pump and control fields interacting with a multilevel atomic system facilitates the generation of mirrorless Stokes and anti-Stokes fields counter-propagating to each other. The maximum generated laser power could rise up to mW with pump conversion efficiency more than 30%. Furthermore, the cross-phase modulation due to the strong Gaussian beams create all-optical waveguides for the generated fields and hence induces different spatial modes in the Stokes as well as the anti-Stokes fields. With suitable experimental parameters, we could generate correlated Gaussian mode or Laguerre-Gaussian mode for both the generated fields.",physics.optics,2018,human

For the long-range contributions, we introduce an integral-direct planewave density fitting, applicable to both compact and diffuse densities. The resulting method achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups for prototypical solid-state systems compared to a closely related approach, the range-separated density fitting method. Using dispersion-corrected PBE functional and all-electron Dunning and Karlsruhe basis sets, we apply our method to compute the cohesive energy of the benzene crystal and the adsorption energy of CO on the MgO(001) surface.

The resulting method is systematically improvable and well suited to large-scale quantum mechanical calculations in which the Coulomb potential and energy of a continuous electronic density and singular nuclear density are required. Linear scaling is achieved by introducing smooth, strictly local neutralizing densities to render nuclear interactions strictly local, and solving the remaining neutral Poisson problem for the electrons in real space. While the formulation includes singular nuclear potentials without smearing approximations, the required Poisson solution is in Sobolev space $H^1$, as required for convergence in the energy norm. We employ enriched finite elements, with enrichments from isolated atom solutions, for an efficient solution of the resulting Poisson problem in the interacting solid. We demonstrate the accuracy and convergence of the approach by direct comparison to standard Ewald sums for a lattice of point charges, and demonstrate the accuracy in all-electron quantum mechanical calculations with an application to crystalline diamond.",cond-mat.mtrl-sci,2010,human

Furthermore, usage of a single shortest path (for routing) implies possible traffic bottleneck, which should be avoided if possible, which we term pathneck security avoidance. Finding all Pareto-optimal solutions for the multi-criteria single-source single-destination shortest secure path problem with non-negative edge lengths might yield a solution with an exponential number of paths. In the first part of this paper, we study specific settings of the multi-criteria shortest secure path problem, which are based on prioritized multi-criteria and on $k$-shortest secure paths. In the second part, we show a polynomial-time algorithm that, given an undirected graph $G$ and a pair of vertices $(s,t)$, finds prioritized multi-criteria $2$-disjoint (vertex/edge) shortest secure paths between $s$ and $t$.

Nonetheless, the current practice of ICL treats all demonstration examples equally, which still warrants improvement, as the quality of examples is usually uneven. In this paper, we investigate how to determine approximately optimal weights for demonstration examples and how to apply them during ICL. To assess the quality of weights in the absence of additional validation data, we design a masked self-prediction (MSP) score that exhibits a strong correlation with the final ICL performance. To expedite the weight-searching process, we discretize the continuous weight space and adopt beam search. With approximately optimal weights obtained, we further propose two strategies to apply them to demonstrations at different model positions.

Relying on Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Differential Privacy (DP), we propose a framework addressing threats on the privacy of the training data. Notably, the proposed framework ensures the privacy of the training data from all actors of the learning process, namely the data owners and the aggregating server. More precisely, while HE blinds a semi-honest server during the learning protocol, DP protects the data from semi-honest clients participating in the training process as well as end-users with black-box or white-box access to the trained model. In order to achieve this, we provide new theoretical and practical results to allow these techniques to be rigorously combined. In particular, by means of a novel stochastic quantisation operator, we prove DP guarantees in a context where the noise is quantised and bounded due to the use of HE. The paper is concluded by experiments which show the practicality of the entire framework in terms of both model quality (impacted by DP) and computational overhead (impacted by HE).","cs.CR,cs.LG",2022,human

Here we present a complete fibre-integrated heralded single photon source that addresses both these difficulties simultaneously. We use active switching to provide a path to deterministic operation by multiplexing separate spontaneous sources, and dispersion engineering to minimise frequency correlation for high-purity single photon generation. All the essential elements -- nonlinear material with dispersion control, wavelength isolation, optical delay, and fast switching -- are incorporated in a low-loss alignment-free package that heralds photons in telecoms single-mode fibre.

In our proposal a petawatt-class laser disturbs the quantum vacuum and creates a delay in a counter-propagating probe laser beam. Placing this delayed beam in one arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), allows the measurement of the vacuum refraction coefficient via a phase shift. Coherent as well as squeezed light are both considered and the minimum phase sensitivity evaluated.

The number of ancillae required to produce a magic state within a target error rate $ε$ is $O(\log^γ (ε^{-1}))$ where $γ$ is known as the yield parameter. Hastings and Haah derived a family of distillation protocols with sublogarithmic overhead (i.e., $γ< 1$) based on punctured Reed-Muller codes. Building on work by Campbell \textit{et al.} and Krishna-Tillich, which suggests that qudits of dimension $p>2$ can significantly reduce overhead, we generalize their construction to qudits of arbitrary prime dimension $p$. We find that, in an analytically tractable puncturing scheme, the number of qudits required to achieve sublogarithmic overhead decreases drastically as $p$ increases, and the asymptotic yield parameter approaches $\frac{1}{\ln p}$ as $p \to \infty$.

These states weakly satisfy the quantum simplicity constraint via the vanishing expectation values, and the quantum Gaussian constraints can be imposed strongly. Remarkably, those specific ${SO(D+1)}$ coherent intertwiners used to construct our solutions have natural interpretations of the $D$-dimensional polytopes, commonly viewed as basic units of the discrete spatial geometry. Therefore, while the strong imposition of the quantum simplicity constraints leads to an over-constrained solution space, our weak solution space for the constraints may contain the correct semiclassical degrees of freedom for intrinsic geometry of the spatial hypersurfaces.

A recent study proposed a novel hypothesis, suggesting that scale-free failure sizes might be inherited from scale-free input characteristics in power networks. However, the scope of this study excluded certain network topologies. Here, motivated by power networks, we strengthen this hypothesis by generalizing to a broader range of graph topologies where this behavior is manifested. Our approach yields a universal theorem applicable to all simple, connected graphs, revealing that when a cascade leads to network disconnections, the total failure size exhibits a scale-free tail inherited from the input characteristics.

Enhancing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), GLoRA employs a generalized prompt module to optimize pre-trained model weights and adjust intermediate activations, providing more flexibility and capability across diverse tasks and datasets. Moreover, GLoRA facilitates efficient parameter adaptation by employing a scalable, modular, layer-wise structure search that learns individual adapter of each layer. Originating from a unified mathematical formulation, GLoRA exhibits strong transfer learning, few-shot learning and domain generalization abilities, as it adapts to new tasks through not only weights but also additional dimensions like activations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GLoRA outperforms all previous methods in natural, specialized, and structured vision benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy with fewer parameters and computations. The proposed method on LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 also show considerable enhancements compared to the original LoRA in the language domain. Furthermore, our structural re-parameterization design ensures that GLoRA incurs no extra inference cost, rendering it a practical solution for resource-limited applications.

Many biomolecules without inversion symmetry such as amino acids and sugars are chiral molecules. Measuring and controlling molecular chirality at a high precision down to the atomic scale are highly desired in physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine, however, have remained challenging. Herein, we achieve all-optical reconfigurable chiral meta-molecules experimentally using metallic and dielectric colloidal particles as artificial atoms or building blocks to serve at least two purposes. One is that the on-demand meta-molecules with strongly enhanced optical chirality are well-suited as substrates for surface-enhanced chiroptical spectroscopy of chiral molecules and as active components in optofluidic and nanophotonic devices. The other is that the bottom-up-assembled colloidal meta-molecules provide microscopic models to better understand the origin of chirality in the actual atomic and molecular systems.

However, the realization of ultrastrong optomechanical interaction remains a big challenge. Here, we present an all-optical scheme to simulate ultrastrong optomechanical coupling based on a Fredkin-type interaction, which consists of two exchange-coupled modes with the coupling strength depending on the photon number in another controller mode. This coupling enhancement is assisted by the displacement amplification according to the physical idea of the Bogoliubov approximation, which is realized by utilizing a strong driving to pump one of the two exchanging modes. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the enhanced optomechanical coupling can enter the single-photon strong-coupling and even ultrastrong-coupling regimes. We also show the creation of macroscopic quantum superposed states and the implementation of a weak-to-strong transition for quantum measurement in this system.

By varying the number of ALD cycles used to form the AlN barrier, we achieve Josephson tunneling through barriers of different thicknesses, with critical current density spanning seven orders of magnitude, demonstrating the uniformity and versatility of the process. Owing to the high critical temperature of NbN, transmon qubits based on these all-nitride trilayers exhibit microsecond-scale relaxation times, even at temperatures above 300 mK.

We find an enhancement of the Schwinger mechanism catalyzed by a magnetic field for spinor QED and, in contrast, a stronger exponential suppression for scalar QED due to the ""zero-point energy"" of the Landau quantization. For QCD, we identify the discretized energy levels of the transverse and longitudinal gluon modes on the basis of their distinct Zeeman energies, and explicitly confirm the cancellation between the longitudinal-gluon and ghost contributions in the Schwinger mechanism.

However, we find that multilingual fine-tuning leads to performance degradation on recent models UniXcoder and CodeT5.   To alleviate the potentially catastrophic forgetting issue in multilingual models, we fix all pre-trained model parameters, insert the parameter-efficient structure adapter, and fine-tune it. Updating only 0.6\% of the overall parameters compared to full-model fine-tuning for each programming language, adapter tuning yields consistent improvements on code search and summarization tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results. In addition, we experimentally show its effectiveness in cross-lingual and low-resource scenarios. Multilingual fine-tuning with 200 samples per programming language approaches the results fine-tuned with the entire dataset on code summarization.

Recently, various approaches have been proposed to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting issue. However, old knowledge learned earlier is commonly less preserved than that learned more recently. In order to reduce the forgetting of particularly earlier learned old knowledge and improve the overall continual learning performance, we propose a simple yet effective fusion mechanism by including all the previously learned feature extractors into the intelligent model. In addition, a new feature extractor is included to the model when learning a new set of classes each time, and a feature extractor pruning is also applied to prevent the whole model size from growing rapidly. Experiments on multiple classification tasks show that the proposed approach can effectively reduce the forgetting of old knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art continual learning performance.","cs.CV,cs.LG",2021,human

For each channel, there is a natural basis in which the evolution is diagonal in color space. The same basis also diagonalizes the color evolution for the soft function. Even though soft functions required for SCET calculations are observable dependent, it is shown that their renormalization group evolution is almost completely determined by a universal structure.

The simulated Planck data include emission from the CMB, the kinetic and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects from galaxy clusters, as well as Galactic dust, free-free and synchrotron emission. Our simulations also assume homogeneous, uncorrelated pixel noise, although this is not a requirement of the method. We find that the MEM technique produces faithful reconstructions of the main input components over the whole sky, without the need to perform a Galactic cut. The CMB power spectrum is accurately recovered up to a multipole of around 2000. The algorithm is parallelised so that the entire reconstruction can be performed in around 6 hr using 30 R10000 processors on an SGI Origin 2000 supercomputer and requires 14 Gb of memory.",astro-ph,2001,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08377v1,Should attention be all we need? The epistemic and ethical implications of unification in machine learning,"""Attention is all you need"" has become a fundamental precept in machine learning research. Originally designed for machine translation, transformers and the attention mechanisms that underpin them now find success across many problem domains. With the apparent domain-agnostic success of transformers, many researchers are excited that similar model architectures can be successfully deployed across diverse applications in vision, language and beyond. We consider the benefits and risks of these waves of unification on both epistemic and ethical fronts. On the epistemic side, we argue that many of the arguments in favor of unification in the natural sciences fail to transfer over to the machine learning case, or transfer over only under assumptions that might not hold. Unification also introduces epistemic risks related to portability, path dependency, methodological diversity, and increased black-boxing. On the ethical side, we discuss risks emerging from epistemic concerns, further marginalizing underrepresented perspectives, the centralization of power, and having fewer models across more domains of application",cs.LG,2022,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22732v1,Dynamic Exponent Market Maker: Personalized Portfolio Manager and One Pool to Trade Them All,"Decentralized exchange platforms such as Uniswap and Balancer operate on several pools where each pool contains two or more cryptocurrencies and constitutes direct trading pairs. The drawbacks here are that liquidity providing requires contribution of tokens in a specific proportion, and trading may require hopping between pools, hence increasing transaction fee and gas fee. We propose an automated market maker (AMM) protocol where liquidity providers can deposit any amount of tokens into the pool. The protocol will preserve the proportion of tokens by total value at the time of deposit and can be seen as a personalized self-balancing portfolio manager. In addition, since the invariant function is dynamic, all exchange pairs are executed from a single composite pool. Nevertheless, the scheme is vulnerable to flash loan attacks and must be used in conjunction with preventive measures.",cs.IT,2025,human

The CI is modeled as a dynamic parameter commanded by Air Traffic Control (ATC), allowing the aircraft to maintain a constant airspeed throughout the climb, while respecting the air traffic regulations. This paper also explores the implications of a time-varying CI on the determination of optimal airspeed and climbing time for all-electric aircraft. Additionally, it provides the necessary equations to calculate both the optimal climb airspeed and climb duration. The proposed methodology has been validated through a simulated scenario that reflects actual operational procedures. As a result, optimal values for climb airspeed, climbing time, and energy consumption have been established, paving the way for future applications of this methodology to advanced air mobility all-electric vehicles.",eess.SY,2024,human

Extensive research has confirmed that no single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths. ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks. Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM.

The method is based on linearization of the partial convective fluxes associated with acoustic waves, in such a way to suppress, or at least mitigate the acoustic time step limitation. Together with replacement of the total energy equation with the entropy transport equation, this approach avoids the inversion of block-banded matrices involved in classical methods, which is replaced by less demanding inversion of standard banded matrices. The method is extended to deal with implicit integration of viscous terms and to multiple space dimensions through approximate factorization, and used as a building block of third-order Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme. Numerical experiments are carried out for isotropic turbulence, plane channel flow, and flow in a square duct. All available data support higher computational efficiency than existing methods, and saving of resources ranging from $85\%$ under low-subsonic flow conditions, to about $50\%$ in supersonic flow.",physics.flu-dyn,2016,human

The effect originates from the interplay of the two magnetization-dependent contributions to the material absorption, both of which are enhanced under plasmon excitation. Similar to the recently discovered effect of a all-optical helicity-dependent magnetization switching, this effect provides a possibility to perform a deterministic magnetization switching to the desired state. We show by electromagnetic modeling that laser pulses exciting counter-propagating plasmons can be used to write +M or -M state in a deterministic way independent on the initial magnetization state. The presented approach applies to various ferrimagnetic materials exhibiting the phenomenon of all-optical switching of thermal nature and broadens the horizons of their applications in data storage devices.",physics.optics,2022,human

http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2812v1,A priori error estimates for compatible spectral discretization of the Stokes problem for all admissible boundary conditions,"This paper describes the recently developed mixed mimetic spectral element method for the Stokes problem in the vorticity-velocity-pressure formulation. This compatible discretization method relies on the construction of a conforming discrete Hodge decomposition, that is based on a bounded projection operator that commutes with the exterior derivative. The projection operator is the composition of a reduction and a reconstruction step. The reconstruction in terms of mimetic spectral element basis-functions are tensor-based constructions and therefore hold for curvilinear quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes. For compatible discretization methods that contain a conforming discrete Hodge decomposition, we derive optimal a priori error estimates which are valid for all admissible boundary conditions on both Cartesian and curvilinear meshes. These theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments. These clearly show that the mimetic spectral elements outperform the commonly used H(div)-compatible Raviart-Thomas elements.","math.NA,physics.flu-dyn",2012,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12445v2,DeAR: Accelerating Distributed Deep Learning with Fine-Grained All-Reduce Pipelining,"Communication scheduling has been shown to be effective in accelerating distributed training, which enables all-reduce communications to be overlapped with backpropagation computations. This has been commonly adopted in popular distributed deep learning frameworks. However, there exist two fundamental problems: (1) excessive startup latency proportional to the number of workers for each all-reduce operation; (2) it only achieves sub-optimal training performance due to the dependency and synchronization requirement of the feed-forward computation in the next iteration. We propose a novel scheduling algorithm, DeAR, that decouples the all-reduce primitive into two continuous operations, which overlaps with both backpropagation and feed-forward computations without extra communications. We further design a practical tensor fusion algorithm to improve the training performance. Experimental results with five popular models show that DeAR achieves up to 83% and 15% training speedup over the state-of-the-art solutions on a 64-GPU cluster with 10Gb/s Ethernet and 100Gb/s InfiniBand interconnects, respectively.","cs.LG,cs.DC",2023,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5186v1,All CAT(0) Boundaries of Croke-Kleiner-Admissible Groups are Equivariantly CE Equivalent],"Question 2.6 of Bestvina's Questions in Geometric Group Theory asks whether every pair of boundaries of a given CAT(0) group G is cell-like equivalent. The question was posed by Bestvina shortly after the discovery, by Croke and Kleiner, of a CAT(0) group that admits multiple boundaries. Previously, it had been observed by Bestvina and Geoghegan that all boundaries of a torsion free CAT(0) G would necessarily have the same shape. Since ""cell-like equivalence"" is weaker than topological equivalence, but in most circumstances, stronger (and more intuitive) than shape equivalence, this question is a natural one when working with the pathological types of spaces that occur as group boundaries. Furthermore, the definition of cell-like equivalence allows for a obvious G-equivariant extension.   In this paper we provide a positive answer to Bestvina's G-equivariant Cell-like Equivalence Question for the class of admissible groups studied by Croke and Kleiner in 2002. Since that collection includes the original Croke-Kleiner group, our result provides a strong solution to Q2.6, for the group that originally motivated the question.",math.GT,2013,human

We expect future smart glasses will need to be all-day wearable, adopting a small form factor to meet the requirements of volume, weight, fashionability and social acceptability, which puts significant constraints on the space of possible solutions. Additional challenges arise due to the fact that smart glasses are worn in arbitrary environments while their wearer moves and performs everyday activities. In this paper, we systematically analyze the space of imaging from smart glasses and derive several fundamental limits that govern this imaging domain. We discuss the impact of these limits on achievable image quality and camera module size -- comparing in particular to related devices such as mobile phones. We then propose a novel distributed imaging approach that allows to minimize the size of the individual camera modules when compared to a standard monolithic camera design. Finally, we demonstrate the properties of this novel approach in a series of experiments using synthetic data as well as images captured with two different prototype implementations.",cs.CV,2025,human

When the system is linear and the cost is convex, the System Level Synthesis (SLS) approach offers an effective solution based on convex programming. Beyond this case, a globally optimal solution cannot be found in a tractable way, in general. In this paper, we develop a parametrization of all and only the control policies stabilizing a given time-varying nonlinear system in terms of the combined effect of 1) a strongly stabilizing base controller and 2) a stable SLS operator to be freely designed. Based on this result, we propose a Neural SLS (Neur-SLS) approach guaranteeing closed-loop stability during and after parameter optimization, without requiring any constraints to be satisfied. We exploit recent Deep Neural Network (DNN) models based on Recurrent Equilibrium Networks (RENs) to learn over a rich class of nonlinear stable operators, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in numerical examples.","eess.SY,cs.LG",2022,human

Recent studies suggest using Large Language Models (LLMs) as reference-free metrics for NLG evaluation, however, they remain unexplored for opinion summary evaluation. Moreover, limited opinion summary evaluation datasets inhibit progress. To address this, we release the SUMMEVAL-OP dataset covering 7 dimensions related to the evaluation of opinion summaries: fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness, aspect coverage, sentiment consistency, and specificity. We investigate Op-I-Prompt a dimension-independent prompt, and Op-Prompts, a dimension-dependent set of prompts for opinion summary evaluation. Experiments indicate that Op-I-Prompt emerges as a good alternative for evaluating opinion summaries achieving an average Spearman correlation of 0.70 with humans, outperforming all previous approaches.

Recent works revealed oscillatory internal motions of these bound states, akin to molecular vibrations[4-8]. These observations beg the question as to how far the ""molecular"" analogy reaches, whether further concepts from molecular spectroscopy apply in this scenario, and if such intra-molecular dynamics can be externally driven or manipulated. Here, we probe and control such ultrashort bound-states in an optical oscillator, utilizing real-time spectroscopy and time-dependent external perturbations. We introduce two-dimensional spectroscopy of the linear and nonlinear bound-state response and resolve anharmonicities in the soliton interaction leading to overtone and sub-harmonic generation.

It is revealed that such nontrivial invisibility originates from not only the simultaneous excitations of both electric and magnetic resonances, but also their significant magnetoelectric cross-interactions. We further show that the invisibility obtained is both polarization and direction selective, which can probably play a significant role in various applications including non-invasive detection, sensing, and non-disturbing medical diagnosis with high sensitivity and precision.",physics.optics,2017,human

To evaluate this approach, we create a multilingual Winograd Schema corpus by processing several datasets from prior work within a standardized pipeline and measure cross-lingual generalization ability in terms of out-of-sample performance. The method performs competitively with recent supervised and unsupervised approaches for commonsense reasoning, even when applied to other languages in a zero-shot manner. Also, we demonstrate that most of the performance is given by the same small subset of attention heads for all studied languages, which provides evidence of universal reasoning capabilities in multilingual encoders.","cs.CL,cs.LG",2021,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06994v3,ADL-MVDR: All deep learning MVDR beamformer for target speech separation,"Speech separation algorithms are often used to separate the target speech from other interfering sources. However, purely neural network based speech separation systems often cause nonlinear distortion that is harmful for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. The conventional mask-based minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer can be used to minimize the distortion, but comes with high level of residual noise. Furthermore, the matrix operations (e.g., matrix inversion) involved in the conventional MVDR solution are sometimes numerically unstable when jointly trained with neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel all deep learning MVDR framework, where the matrix inversion and eigenvalue decomposition are replaced by two recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to resolve both issues at the same time. The proposed method can greatly reduce the residual noise while keeping the target speech undistorted by leveraging on the RNN-predicted frame-wise beamforming weights.

Main findings include a persistent East-West European division across applications, with clustering generally improving forecast accuracy over single-country models.

Its purpose is to find the brightest transiting exoplanet systems, expected in the V=4-8 magnitude range - currently not probed by space- or ground-based surveys. The bright/nearby transiting planet systems, which MASCARA will discover, will be the key targets for detailed planet atmosphere observations. We present studies on the initial design of a MASCARA station, including the camera housing, domes, and computer equipment, and on the photometric stability of low-cost cameras showing that a precision of 0.3-1% per hour can be readily achieved. We plan to roll out the first MASCARA station before the end of 2013.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07715v2,Not All Neighbors Are Worth Attending to: Graph Selective Attention Networks for Semi-supervised Learning,"Graph attention networks (GATs) are powerful tools for analyzing graph data from various real-world scenarios. To learn representations for downstream tasks, GATs generally attend to all neighbors of the central node when aggregating the features. In this paper, we show that a large portion of the neighbors are irrelevant to the central nodes in many real-world graphs, and can be excluded from neighbor aggregation. Taking the cue, we present Selective Attention (SA) and a series of novel attention mechanisms for graph neural networks (GNNs). SA leverages diverse forms of learnable node-node dissimilarity to acquire the scope of attention for each node, from which irrelevant neighbors are excluded. We further propose Graph selective attention networks (SATs) to learn representations from the highly correlated node features identified and investigated by different SA mechanisms. Lastly, theoretical analysis on the expressive power of the proposed SATs and a comprehensive empirical study of the SATs on challenging real-world datasets against state-of-the-art GNNs are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of SATs.",cs.LG,2022,human

In this paper, we describe two computational schemes that can potentially solve this problem. We consider systems of poorly soluble drug compounds in supercritical carbon dioxide. Considering that the biggest contribution among all inter-molecular interactions is made by van der Waals interactions, we model solute and solvent particles as coarse-grained ones interacting via the effective Lennard-Jones potential. The first proposed approach is based on the classical density functional theory and the second one relies on molecular dynamics simulation of the Lennard-Jones fluid. Sacrificing the precision of the molecular structure description while capturing the phase behavior of the fluid with sufficient accuracy, we propose computationally advantageous paths to obtaining the solvation free energy values with the accuracy satisfactory for engineering applications. The agreement reached between the results of such coarse-graining models and the experimental data indicates that the use of the all-atom molecular dynamic simulations for the studied systems seems to be excessive.","physics.chem-ph,cond-mat.soft",2021,human

For example, when sample size is under-estimated, the statistical inference, even with the correct analysis methods, will not be able to detect the true significant improvement leading to misinformed and costly decisions. This paper addresses this fundamental gap by developing new sample size calculation methods for correlated data, as well as absolute vs. relative treatment effects, both ubiquitous in online experiments. Additionally, we address a practical question of the minimal observed difference that will be statistically significant and how it relates to average treatment effect and sample size calculation.

Beyond this low-field regime, the optical signal quenches and a quantitative measurement is challenging. While the field-dependent NV photoluminescence can still provide qualitative information on magnetic morphology, this operation regime remains unexplored particularly for surface magnetisation larger than $\sim$ 3 mA. Here, we introduce a multi-angle reconstruction technique (MARe) that captures the full nanoscale domain morphology in all magnetic-field regimes leading to NV photoluminescence quench. To demonstrate this, we use [Ir/Co/Pt]$_{14}$ multilayer films with surface magnetisation an order of magnitude larger than previous reports.

However, up until now benchmarks of RDF stores were most often conducted with only one dataset, and the differences between the datasets were not explored in detail. In this paper, our objective is to close this research gap by experimentally evaluating the load times of eight diverse RDF datasets from the RiverBench benchmark suite. In the experiments, we use five different RDF store implementations and several resource-constrained hardware platforms. To analyze the results, we introduce the notion of relative loading speed (RLS), allowing us to observe that the loading speed can differ between datasets by as much as a factor of 9.01. This serves as clear evidence that ``not all RDF is created equal'' and stresses the importance of using multiple benchmark datasets in evaluations. We outline the possible reasons for this drastic difference, which should be further investigated in future work.

For all-digital architectures to be competitive with hybrid solutions in terms of power consumption, novel signal-processing methods and baseband architectures are necessary. In this paper, we demonstrate that adapting the resolution of the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and spatial equalizer of an all-digital system to the communication scenario (e.g., the number of users, modulation scheme, and propagation conditions) enables orders-of-magnitude power savings for realistic mmWave channels. For example, for a 256-BS-antenna 16-user system supporting 1 GHz bandwidth, a traditional baseline architecture designed for a 64-user worst-case scenario would consume 23 W in 28 nm CMOS for the ADC array and the spatial equalizer, whereas a resolution-adaptive architecture is able to reduce the power consumption by 6.7x.","eess.SP,cs.IT",2021,human

In a very recent report, the structures of chiral carbon nanorings (which may serve as chemical templates for synthesizing chiral nanotubes) were experimentally synthesized and characterized for the first time. Here, in our communication, we show that the excited-state properties of these unique chiral nanorings exhibit anomalous and extremely interesting optoelectronic properties, with excitation energies growing larger as a function of size (in contradiction with typical quantum confinement effects). While the first electronic excitation in armchair nanorings is forbidden with a weak oscillator strength, we find that the same excitation in chiral nanorings is allowed due to a strong geometric symmetry breaking. Most importantly, among all the possible nanorings synthesized in this fashion, we show that only one ring, corresponding to a SWNT with chiral indices (n+3,n+1), is extremely special with large photoinduced transitions that are most readily observable in spectroscopic experiments.","cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.chem-ph",2011,human

Despite being popular and effective, these methods still have a few shortcomings that limit empirical performance. In this paper, we start by identifying the discrepancy between training and evaluation in the existing multi-class classification framework and then discuss the potential limitations caused by the ""competitive"" nature of softmax normalization. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a novel binary classification training framework, termed SphereFace2. In contrast to existing methods, SphereFace2 circumvents the softmax normalization, as well as the corresponding closed-set assumption. This effectively bridges the gap between training and evaluation, enabling the representations to be improved individually by each binary classification task. Besides designing a specific well-performing loss function, we summarize a few general principles for this ""one-vs-all"" binary classification framework so that it can outperform current competitive methods. Our experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate that SphereFace2 can consistently outperform state-of-the-art deep face recognition methods.

Part of the paper is devoted to providing an appropriate function space setting as well as establishing the required differentiability results needed for well-definedness and convergence of the methods under consideration. Based on this, we formulate and compare the above mentioned iterative methods in their all-at-once and their reduced version.

An out-of-plane electric field breaks the layer degeneracy, leading to a gate-tunable spin-polarized current whose polarization can be fully reversed upon flipping the polarity of the electric field. Using first-principles calculations, we show that CrS bilayer with C-type antiferromagnetic exchange interaction exhibits a hidden layer-spin locking mechanism that enables the spin polarization of the transport current to be electrically manipulated via the layer degree of freedom. We demonstrate that sign-reversible spin polarization as high as 87% can be achieved at room temperature.

Although the hyper-converged design comes with a number of benefits, it makes crucial operational tasks, such as capacity planning and cost analysis, fairly complicated. The problem becomes more onerous if we consider a complex distributed system, such as Ceph, for the cloud with the proliferation of SSD drives. In this paper, we aim to answer some of these questions based on comprehensive microbenchmarks, and consequently better understand the behavior of Ceph in a hyper-converged cloud with all-flash storage. We reported our findings based on the study, devised a cost model and compared the cost of hyper-converged architecture with dedicated storage architecture. Additionally we summarized our experience based on the interactions with many teams at AT&T in the past couple of years.",cs.DC,2018,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09285v2,Rescuing The Primordial Black Holes all-Dark Matter Hypothesis from The Fast Radio Bursts Tension,"Primordial black holes (PBHs) as an all-dark matter (DM) hypothesis has recently been demotivated by the prediction that these objects would source an excessive rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, these predictions were based on several simplifying assumptions to which this rate is highly sensitive. In this article, we improve previous estimates of this rate arising from the capture of PBHs by neutron stars (NSs), aiming to revitalise this theory. We more accurately compute the velocity distribution functions of PBHs and NSs and also consider an enhancement in the NS and DM density profiles at galactic centers due to the presence of a central supermassive black hole. We find that previous estimates of the rate of FRBs sourced by the capture of PBHs by NSs were 3 orders of magnitude too large, concluding that the PBHs as all DM hypothesis remains a viable theory and that the observed FRB rate can only be entirely explained when considering a central, sufficiently spiky PBH density profile.","hep-ph,astro-ph.HE",2023,human

However, the all-electrical control of such systems at room temperature, a crucial step toward practical applications, has not been reported. Here using a small writing current of around 5*10^{6} A/cm^{2}, we realize the all-electrical current-induced deterministic switching of the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn with a strong readout signal at room temperature in the Si/SiO2/Mn3Sn/AlOx structure, without external magnetic field and injected spin current. Our simulations reveal that the switching is originated from the current-induced intrinsic non-collinear spin-orbit torques in Mn3Sn itself. Our findings pave the way for the development of topological antiferromagnetic spintronics.","cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.app-ph",2022,human

Due to its importance for the ubiquitous ionisation process, numerous heuristic attempts have been made during the last several decades to account for the final state Coulomb interaction with in the SFA. Also to this end an ad hoc model with the so-called Coulomb-Volkov final state was introduced a long time ago. However, till now, no systematic strong-field S-matrix expansion using the Coulomb-Volkov final state could be found. Here we solve this long standing problem by determining the Coulomb-Volkov Hamiltonian, identifying the rest-interaction in the final state, and explicitly constructng the Coulomb-Volkov propagator (or Green's function). We employ them to derive the complete S-matrix series for the ionisation amplitude governed by the Coulomb-Volkov final state in all orders. The results are given in both ""velocity"" and ""length"" gauges. We also present a gauge independent version of the Coulomb-Volkov S-matrix series.",physics.atom-ph,2016,human

Due to presence of the complete form of S-matrix, several new contact interactions as well as new couplings are explored.

However, existing gradient compressors face notable limitations: Rand-$K$ discards structural information and performs poorly in practice, while Top-$K$ preserves informative entries but loses the contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper, we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant information. ARC-Top-$K$ is provably contractive and, when combined with momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions. Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$ while reducing wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$ with the strong performance of Top-$K$.","cs.LG,cs.DC",2025,human

Although Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering has been explored via violations of steering inequalities both theoretically and experimentally, the known inequalities in the literatures are far from well-developed. As a result, it is not yet possible to observe Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering for some steerable mixed states. Recently, a simple approach was presented to identify Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering based on all-versus-nothing argument, offering a strong condition to witness the steerability of a family of two-qubit (pure or mixed) entangled states. In this work, we show that the all-versus-nothing proof of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering can be tested by measuring the projective probabilities. Through the bound of probabilities imposed by local-hidden-state model, the proposed test shows that steering can be detected by the all-versus-nothing argument experimentally even in the presence of imprecision and errors. Our test can be implemented in many physical systems and we discuss the possible realizations of our scheme with non-Abelian anyons and trapped ions.",quant-ph,2014,human

We also exclude the possibility of having a Poiseuille's flow profile to be one of these stationary Navier-Stokes flows with isotropic streamlines. When the sphere is replaced by a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space, we also give the analog existence result for stationary parallel laminar Navier-Stokes flows along a circular-arc boundary portion of some compact obstacle in the 2-D hyperbolic space. The existence of stationary parallel laminar Navier-Stokes flows along a straight boundary of some obstacle in the 2-D hyperbolic space is also studied.

To achieve this goal, the models are expected to focus only on image content-related features instead of overfitting degradations. Recently, numerous approaches such as Dropout and Feature Alignment have been proposed to suppress models' natural tendency to overfit degradations and yield promising results. Nevertheless, these works have assumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise, JPEG), while through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models predominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to its distinct degradation pattern compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we propose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and denoising modules. Our approach presents a general solution that can be seamlessly integrated with existing super-resolution models without requiring architectural modifications. Our framework demonstrates superior performance compared to previous regularization-based methods across five traditional benchmarks and datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios.","cs.CV,cs.AI",2025,human

In this paper, we explore this out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem for image classification using clusters of semantically similar embeddings of the training data and exploit the differences in distance relationships to these clusters between in- and out-of-distribution data. We study the structure and separation of clusters in the embedding space and find that supervised contrastive learning leads to well-separated clusters while its self-supervised counterpart fails to do so. In our extensive analysis of different training methods, clustering strategies, distance metrics, and thresholding approaches, we observe that there is no clear winner. The optimal approach depends on the model architecture and selected datasets for in- and out-of-distribution. While we could reproduce the outstanding results for contrastive training on CIFAR-10 as in-distribution data, we find standard cross-entropy paired with cosine similarity outperforms all contrastive training methods when training on CIFAR-100 instead. Cross-entropy provides competitive results as compared to expensive contrastive training methods.",cs.CV,2022,human

Like the radial peculiar velocities of galaxies, transverse peculiar velocities are a means to trace the density of matter that does not rely on light tracing mass. Unlike radial peculiar velocity measurements that require precise redshift-independent distances in order to distinguish between the Hubble expansion and the observed redshift, transverse peculiar velocities can be measured using redshifts alone as a proxy for distance. Extragalactic proper motions can therefore directly measure peculiar velocities and probe the matter power spectrum. Here we develop two-point transverse velocity correlation statistics and demonstrate their dependence on the matter power spectrum. We predict the power in these correlation statistics as a function of the physical separation, angular separation, and distance of pairs of galaxies and demonstrate that the effect of large scale structure on transverse motions is best measured for pairs of objects with comoving separations less than about 50 Mpc. Transverse peculiar velocities induced by large scale structure should be observable as proper motions using long baseline radio interferometry or space-based optical astrometry.",astro-ph.CO,2018,human

To address this gap, we construct SpeechRole-Data, a large-scale, high-quality dataset that comprises 98 diverse roles and 112k speech-based single-turn and multi-turn conversations. Each role demonstrates distinct vocal characteristics, including timbre and prosody, thereby enabling more sophisticated speech role-playing. Furthermore, we propose SpeechRole-Eval, a multidimensional evaluation benchmark that systematically assesses SRPAs performance in key aspects such as fundamental interaction ability, speech expressiveness, and role-playing fidelity. Experimental results reveal the advantages and challenges of both cascaded and end-to-end speech role-playing agents in maintaining vocal style consistency and role coherence.

First, the syntax and the semantics of the calculus are presented, then expressiveness and effectiveness of AbC are demonstrated both in terms of modeling scenarios featuring collaboration, reconfiguration, and adaptation and of the possibility of encoding channel-based interactions and other interaction patterns.

Earlier sub-models are trained to handle easy and confident regions, and they progressively feed-forward harder regions to the next sub-model for processing. Convolutions are only calculated on these regions to reduce computations. The proposed method possesses several advantages. First, LC classifies most of the easy regions in the shallow stage and makes deeper stage focuses on a few hard regions. Such an adaptive and 'difficulty-aware' learning improves segmentation performance. Second, LC accelerates both training and testing of deep network thanks to early decisions in the shallow stage. Third, in comparison to MC, LC is an end-to-end trainable framework, allowing joint learning of all sub-models.

Radiative heat management provides unique advantages because the heat transfer can be controlled by the surface. However, different surface emissivities require different tuning strategies. Here, we demonstrate a triple-mode mid-infrared modulator that can switch between passive heating and cooling suitable for all types of object surface emissivities. The device is composed of a surface-textured infrared-semi-transparent elastomer coated with a metallic back reflector, which is biaxially strained to sequentially achieve three fundamental modes: emission, reflection, and transmission. By analyzing and optimizing the coupling between optical and mechanical properties, we achieve a performance of emittance contrast = 0.58, transmittance contrast = 0.49, and reflectance contrast = 0.39. The device can provide a new design paradigm of radiation heat regulation to develop the next generation wearable devices, robotics, and camouflage technology.","physics.app-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.soft,physics.optics",2021,human

The increasing pervasiveness of AI-generated text and the difficulty in detecting it poses new challenges for our society. In this paper, we tackle the problem of detecting and attributing AI-generated text by proposing WhosAI, a triplet-network contrastive learning framework designed to predict whether a given input text has been generated by humans or AI and to unveil the authorship of the text. Unlike most existing approaches, our proposed framework is conceived to learn semantic similarity representations from multiple generators at once, thus equally handling both detection and attribution tasks. Furthermore, WhosAI is model-agnostic and scalable to the release of new AI text-generation models by incorporating their generated instances into the embedding space learned by our framework. Experimental results on the TuringBench benchmark of 200K news articles show that our proposed framework achieves outstanding results in both the Turing Test and Authorship Attribution tasks, outperforming all the methods listed in the TuringBench benchmark leaderboards.","cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.CY,cs.HC,physics.soc-ph",2024,human

OrbitAll demonstrates superior performance and generalization on predicting charged, open-shell, and solvated molecules, while also robustly extrapolating to molecules significantly larger than the training data by leveraging a physics-informed architecture. OrbitAll achieves chemical accuracy using 10 times fewer training data than competing AI models, with a speedup of approximately $10^3$ - $10^4$ compared to density functional theory.","cs.LG,physics.chem-ph",2025,human

Building on these distinct electronic structures, we propose all-electrically controlled spin filter and spin valve devices, where quantum resonant tunneling enables highly spin-polarized conductance tunable via gate voltage and interface transparency. In particular, we find that strong altermagnets allow gate-tunable full spin polarization that is robust against interface scattering and can be reversed by gate control. We further demonstrate that a double-gated spin valve electrically switches between parallel and antiparallel spin configurations, analogous to magnetic junctions but without the need for external magnetic fields. Our results establish both weak and strong altermagnets as promising platforms for realizing magnetic-field-free electrically tunable spintronic functionalities.","cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph",2025,human

However, producing the vast quantities of road marking labels required for training state-of-the-art deep networks is costly, time-consuming, and simply infeasible for every domain and condition. In addition, training data retrieved from virtual worlds often lack the richness and complexity of the real world and consequently cannot be used directly. In this paper, we provide an alternative approach in which new road marking training pairs are automatically generated. To this end, we apply principles of domain randomization to the road layout and synthesize new images from altered semantic labels. We demonstrate that training on these synthetic pairs improves mIoU of the segmentation of rare road marking classes during real-world deployment in complex urban environments by more than 12 percentage points, while performance for other classes is retained. This framework can easily be scaled to all domains and conditions to generate large-scale road marking datasets, while avoiding manual labelling effort.","cs.RO,cs.CV",2019,human

We will correct these claims and put them into the right perspective: First, the conformal invariance as proposed by Waclawczyk et al. is not related to the result that zero-isolines of the scalar field in the inverse energy cascade display a Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE). Second, the conformal invariance is not a Lie-group for all values of the scalar field since it inherently violates the smoothness axiom of a Lie-group action, with the effect that a physical PDF gets mapped to a non-physical one. Third, although Waclawczyk et al. recognize that their conformal invariance does not constitute a symmetry but only a weaker equivalence transformation, it is still not classified correctly. The claim that their equivalence can map between solutions is not true. This fact will be demonstrated by using an illustrative example.",physics.flu-dyn,2021,human

This is achieved with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in stanene nanoribbons by tuning the relative phase of spin up and down electrons using a gate voltage, which creates a time delay between them thereby producing alternative SPCs driven by ac voltage. The control and generation of SPCs are demonstrated numerically for ac transport in both transient and ac regime. Our results are robust against edge imperfections and generally valid for other QSH insulators such as silicene and germanene, etc. These findings establish a novel route for generating SPCs by purely electrical means and open the door for new applications of semiconductor spintronics.",cond-mat.mes-hall,2016,human

http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14885v1,Text is All You Need: Personalizing ASR Models using Controllable Speech Synthesis,"Adapting generic speech recognition models to specific individuals is a challenging problem due to the scarcity of personalized data. Recent works have proposed boosting the amount of training data using personalized text-to-speech synthesis. Here, we ask two fundamental questions about this strategy: when is synthetic data effective for personalization, and why is it effective in those cases? To address the first question, we adapt a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to target speakers from four benchmark datasets representative of different speaker types. We show that ASR personalization with synthetic data is effective in all cases, but particularly when (i) the target speaker is underrepresented in the global data, and (ii) the capacity of the global model is limited. To address the second question of why personalized synthetic data is effective, we use controllable speech synthesis to generate speech with varied styles and content. Surprisingly, we find that the text content of the synthetic data, rather than style, is important for speaker adaptation. These results lead us to propose a data selection strategy for ASR personalization based on speech content.","eess.AS,cs.LG,cs.SD",2023,human

We adopt the so-called subtractive approach, in which one can systematically construct contributions for subtracting long-distance effects represented by diagrams. The perturbative parts are obtained after the subtraction. We find that the perturbative coefficients of all structure functions in TMD factorization at leading twist are the same. The perturbative parts can also be studied with scattering of partons instead of hadrons. In this way, the factorization of many structure functions can only be examined by studying the scattering of multi-parton states, where there are many diagrams. These diagrams have no similarities to those treated in the subtractive approach. As an example, we use existing results of one structure function responsible for Single-Spin-Asymmetry, to show that these diagrams in the scattering of multi-parton states are equivalent to those treated in the subtractive approach after using Ward identity.",hep-ph,2013,human

Let us denote by $T^{(1)}$ the famous Ehrlich method (1967). Starting from $T^{(1)}$, Kjurkchiev and Andreev (1987) have introduced recursively a sequence ${(T^{(N)})_{N=1}^\infty}$ of iterative methods for simultaneous finding polynomial zeros. For given $N \ge 1$, the Ehrlich-type method $T^{(N)}$ has the order of convergence ${2 N + 1}$. In this paper, we establish two new local convergence theorems as well as a semilocal convergence theorem (under computationally verifiable initial conditions and with a posteriori error estimate) for the Ehrlich-type methods $T^{(N)}$. Our first local convergence theorem generalizes a result of Proinov (2015) and improves the result of Kjurkchiev and Andreev (1987). The second local convergence theorem generalizes another recent result of Proinov (2015), but only in the case of maximum-norm. Our semilocal convergence theorem is the first result in this direction.",math.NA,2015,human

While the advance of pretrained multilingual encoders suggests an easy optimism of ""train on English, run on any language"", we find through a thorough exploration and extension of techniques that a combination of approaches, both new and old, leads to better performance than any one cross-lingual strategy in particular. We explore techniques including data projection and self-training, and how different pretrained encoders impact them. We use English-to-Arabic IE as our initial example, demonstrating strong performance in this setting for event extraction, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. We then apply data projection and self-training to three tasks across eight target languages.

Here, we propose an alternative all-in-one spin device whose operation principle relies on electric manipulation of the spin lifetime in two-dimensional (2D) SnTe, in which the sizable spin Hall effect eliminates the need for using ferromagnets. In particular, we explore the persistent spin texture (PST) intrinsically present in the ferroelectric phase which protects the spin from decoherence and supports extraordinarily long spin lifetime. Our first-principles calculations followed by symmetry arguments revealed that such a spin wave mode can be externally detuned by perpendicular electric field, leading to spin randomization and decrease in spin lifetime. We further extend our analysis to ultrathin SnTe films and confirm the emergence of PST as well as a moderate enhancement of intrinsic spin Hall conductivity. The recent room-temperature observation of the ferroelectric phase in 2D-SnTe suggests that novel all-electric spintronics devices are within reach.",cond-mat.mtrl-sci,2019,human

The key innovation is our characterization of anomalies through the constraint ideal in the polynomial ring of generalized curvatures and connections of the underlying symmetry (super)-Lie algebra.   We demonstrate that anomalies in dimension $d$ are captured by the cohomology $H_δ(W_{d+2})$ of the generalized BRST operator $δ$ acting on the fermion number $d+2$ component of the constraint ideal $W_{d+2}$. While Yang-Mills anomalies correspond to invariant Chern curvature polynomials (where $W_{d+2}$ reduces to homogeneous curvature polynomials), the constraint ideal for 4D (super)conformal gravity contains additional polynomials mixing curvatures and connections.

However, destructive quantum interference can be induced by a free-space weak control laser tuned to the multi-polariton excitation. As a consequence, the CQED system acts as a coherent perfect light absorber/transmitter as the control field is turned on/off the polariton resonances. In particular, the proposed scheme may be used to realize broadband multi-throw all-optical switching in the nonlinear excitation regime.

Mn ions in GaAs form a natural example. In the ion's ground state the Mn core spin magnetic moment locks antiparallel to the spin and orbital magnetic moment of a bound valence hole from the GaAs host. Direct electrical manipulation of the ion spin is possible because electric fields manipulate the orbital wave function of the hole, and through the spin-orbit coupling the spin is reoriented as well. Coupling two or more ion spins can be achieved using electrical gates to control the size of the valence hole wave function near the semiconductor surface. This proposal for coherent manipulation of individual ionic spins and controlled coupling of ionic spins via electrical gates alone may find applications in extremely high density information storage and in scalable coherent or quantum information processing.","quant-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci",2006,human

Recent experimental advances confirm the possibility of further tuning the electronic properties of MoS2 through the fabrication of single-layer heterostructures consisting of semiconducting (2H) and metallic (1T) MoS2 phases. Nonetheless, despite significant technological and scientific interest, there is currently limited information concerning the mechanical properties of these heterostructure systems. This investigation aims to extend our understanding of the mechanical properties of all-MoS2 single-layer structures at room temperature.

We first studied the direction dependent mechanical properties of defect-free 2H and 1T phases. Our modelling results for pristine 2H MoS2 were found to be in good agreement with the experimental tests and first-principles theoretical predictions.

We start by considering bipartite cases wherein one of the two parties has two settings and two outcomes. Regardless of the number of measurements and outcomes of the other party, the Hilbert space dimension of the first party can be limited to two while still achieving all convexly extremal quantum correlations. We then leverage Schmidt decomposition to show that the remaining party can losslessly also be restricted to a qubit Hilbert space. We then extend this idea to multipartite scenarios. We also adapt our results to provide upper bounds of local Hilbert space dimensions to achieve any quantum correlation, including convexly non-extremal correlations, by utilizing Caratheodory's theorem. Finally, we generalize our results to nonstandard Bell scenarios with communication. Taken together, our results fill in several previously unresolved aspects of the problem of determining sufficient Hilbert space dimensionality, expanding the collection of scenarios for which finite-dimensional quantum systems are known to be sufficient to reproduce any quantum correlation.",quant-ph,2025,human

The formation of a stable CT state is found to be sensitive to the distance between two oppositely charged polarons and the relevant critical electrostatic potential is thus quantified. In order to get insight into the dependence of dissociation of CT state on the width of interfacial layer, two quantities are calculated: One is the Coulomb capture radius between two polarons and the other is the quantum trace distance which serves as the fingerprint of the quantum coherence between them. The dissociation of CT state is found to take place within an ultrafast timescale for an optimum interfacial width.

Refining an argument due to H. Bray we obtain an effective volume comparison theorem in Schwarzschild. We use it to show that isoperimetric regions exist in (M, g) for all sufficiently large volumes, and that they are close to centered coordinate spheres. This implies that the volume-preserving stable constant mean curvature spheres constructed by G. Huisken and S.-T. Yau as well as R. Ye as perturbations of large centered coordinate spheres minimize area among all competing surfaces that enclose the same volume. This confirms a conjecture of H. Bray. Our results are consistent with the uniqueness results for volume-preserving stable constant mean curvature surfaces in initial data sets obtained by G. Huisken and S.-T. Yau and strengthened by J. Qing and G. Tian. The additional hypotheses that the surfaces be spherical and far out in the asymptotic region in their results are not necessary in our work.","math.DG,gr-qc",2011,human

To obtain the redshift information for the AKARI FIS sources we crossmatch the catalogue with the SDSS DR8. This also allows us to use emission line properties to divide sources into four categories: i) star-forming galaxies (SFGs), ii) composite galaxies (displaying both star-formation and active nucleus components), iii) Seyfert galaxies, and iv) low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxies.   We find that the Seyfert galaxies have the lowest FIR/radio flux ratios and display excess radio emission when compared to the SFGs. We conclude that FIRC can be used to separate SFGs and AGNs only for the most radio-loud objects.",astro-ph.GA,2019,human

However, the widespread adoption of this technique has been hindered by the complexity and alignment sensitivity of mid-infrared frequency comb sources. Leveraging the underexplored mid-infrared window of silica fibers presents a promising approach to address these challenges. In this study, we present the first experimental demonstration and quantitative numerical description of mid-infrared frequency comb generation in silica fibers. Our all-silica-fiber frequency comb spans over two octaves (0.8 $μ$m to 3.5 $μ$m) with a power output of 100 mW in the mid-infrared region. The amplified quantum noise is suppressed using four-cycle (25 fs) driving pulses, with the carrier-envelope offset frequency exhibiting a signal-to-noise ratio of 40 dB and a free-running bandwidth of 90 kHz. Our developed model provides quantitative guidelines for mid-infrared frequency comb generation in silica fibers, enabling all-fiber frequency comb spectroscopy in diverse fields such as organic synthesis, pharmacokinetics processes, and environmental monitoring.",physics.optics,2024,human

We compute the vacuum polarization tensor of a photon in a static and homogeneous magnetic field by utilizing Schwinger's proper-time method, and obtain a series representation as a result of double integrals analytically performed with respect to proper-time variables. The outcome is expressed in terms of an infinite sum of known functions which is plausibly interpreted as summation over all the Landau levels of fermions. Each contribution from infinitely many Landau levels yields a kinematical condition above which the contribution has an imaginary part. This indicates decay of a sufficiently energetic photon into a fermion-antifermion pair with corresponding Landau level indices. Since we do not resort to any approximation, our result is applicable to the calculation of refractive indices in the whole kinematical region of a photon momentum and in any magnitude of the external magnetic field.","hep-ph,astro-ph.HE,hep-th,nucl-th",2012,human

Quantum theory supports at least two distinct kinds of information (classical and quantum), and a variety of different ways to encode and preserve information in physical systems. A system's ability to carry information is constrained and defined by the noise in its dynamics. This paper introduces an operational framework, using information-preserving structures to classify all the kinds of information that can be perfectly (i.e., with zero error) preserved by quantum dynamics. We prove that every perfectly preserved code has the same structure as a matrix algebra, and that preserved information can always be corrected. We also classify distinct operational criteria for preservation (e.g., ""noiseless"", ""unitarily correctible"", etc.) and introduce two new and natural criteria for measurement-stabilized and unconditionally preserved codes. Finally, for several of these operational critera, we present efficient (polynomial in the state-space dimension) algorithms to find all of a channel's information-preserving structures.",quant-ph,2010,human

With this framework, two unnoticed origins of interface states are demonstrated, and their tunability by changing channel size, orientation and geometry is confirmed. The quantitative study of interface states and their effects on device performance explains why the nanosheet channel is preferred in industry.

In addition to various all-loop cuts manifested by the geometry, we present explicitly new results for the integrand up to five loops, which are much simpler than results in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM.

We investigate whether example difficulty affects GRPO training effectiveness by comparing selection strategies (easy, medium, hard, random) across multiple models and reasoning tasks. Training on the hardest 10\% of examples (those where the base model fails most often) yields dramatic performance gains up to 47\%, while easy examples produce minimal improvements of 3-15\%. This occurs because GRPO requires outcome variance to generate learning signals; hard examples maintain mixed success/failure outcomes throughout training while easy examples quickly converge to consistent success, eliminating learning opportunities. Moreover, models trained on hard examples show superior out-of-distribution generalization, with only hard-trained models achieving meaningful gains on the AIME2025 benchmark. Our findings provide clear guidance: when budget-constrained, prioritize collecting and annotating examples where your base model struggles, as these drive nearly all learning value in GRPO fine-tuning","cs.LG,cs.AI",2025,human

The SEM achieves resolution through elevated polynomial order N and requires two to three orders of magnitude fewer elements than standard finite element approaches do. These reduced element counts place stringent requirements on mesh quality and conformity. Our meshing algorithm is based on a Voronoi decomposition of the sphere centers. Facets of the Voronoi cells are tessellated into quads that are swept to the sphere surface to generate a high-quality base mesh. Refinements to the algorithm include edge collapse to remove slivers, node insertion to balance resolution, localized refinement in the radial direction about each sphere, and mesh optimization.

Here we describe the first all-atom folding simulations of the hairpin ribozyme, using a version of a Go potential with separate secondary and tertiary structure energetic contributions. The ratio of tertiary/secondary interaction energies serves as a proxy for non-specific cation binding: a high ratio corresponds to a high concentration, while a low one mimics low concentration. By studying the unfolding behavior of the RNA over a range of temperature and tertiary/secondary energies, a three-state phase diagram emerges, with folded, unfolded (coil) and transient folding/unfolding tertiary structure species.

In contrast to conventional techniques based on a standing bulk acoustic wave inside a liquid-filled microchannel embedded in an elastic, acoustically hard material, such as glass or silicon, the proposed whole-system resonance does not need a high acoustic contrast between the liquid and surrounding solid. Instead, it relies on the very high acoustic contrast between the solid and the surrounding air. In microchannels of usual dimensions, we demonstrate the existence of whole-system resonances in an all-polymer device, which support acoustophoresis of a quality fully comparable to that of a conventional hard-walled system. Our results open up for using cheap and easily processable polymers in a controlled manner to design and fabricate microfluidic devices for single-use acoustophoresis.","physics.flu-dyn,physics.app-ph",2018,human

The main question we address in this paper is: for which choices of parameters does a $(t, s, v)$-all-or-nothing transform (AONT) exist? More specifically, if we fix $t$ and $v$, we want to determine the maximum integer $s$ such that a $(t, s, v)$-AONT exists. We mainly concentrate on the case $t=2$ for arbitrary values of $v$, where we obtain various necessary as well as sufficient conditions for existence of these objects. We consider both linear and general (linear or nonlinear) AONT. We also show some connections between AONT, orthogonal arrays and resilient functions.","math.CO,cs.CR",2017,human

To support a large variety of downstream audio tasks, such as real-time ASR and audio-call enhancement, a PSE solution should operate in a streaming mode, i.e., input audio cleaning should happen in real-time with a small latency and real-time factor. Personalisation is typically achieved by extracting a target speaker's voice profile from an enrolment audio, in the form of a static embedding vector, and then using it to condition the output of a PSE model. However, a fixed target speaker embedding may not be optimal under all conditions. In this work, we present a streaming Transformer-based PSE model and propose a novel cross-attention approach that gives adaptive target speaker representations. We present extensive experiments and show that our proposed cross-attention approach outperforms competitive baselines consistently, even when our model is only approximately half the size.","eess.AS,cs.SD",2022,human

However, not all videos become outdated; certain classic videos can still attract user's attention. Such bias along temporal dimension can be further aggravated by the matching model between users and videos, because the model learns from preexisting interactions. From real data, we observe that different videos have varying sensitivities to recency in attracting users' attention. Our analysis, based on a causal graph modeling short-video recommendation, suggests that the release interval serves as a confounder, establishing a backdoor path between users and videos. To address this confounding effect, we propose a model-agnostic causal architecture called Learning to Deconfound the Release Interval Bias (LDRI). LDRI enables jointly learning of the matching model and the video recency sensitivity perceptron. In the inference stage, we apply a backdoor adjustment, effectively blocking the backdoor path by intervening on each video. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that LDRI consistently outperforms backbone models and exhibits superior performance against state-of-the-art models. Additional comprehensive analyses confirm the deconfounding capability of LDRI.",cs.IR,2024,human

It is theoretically proposed to realize terahertz-order detection bandwidth by using all-optical phase-sensitive detection with an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). However, there have been experimental obstacles to achieve large parametric gain for continuous waves, which is required for use in quantum computation. Here, we adopt a fiber-coupled $χ^{(2)}$ OPA made of a periodically poled LiNbO${}_{3}$ waveguide with high durability for intense continuous-wave pump light. Thanks to that, we manage to detect quadrature amplitudes of broadband continuous-wave squeezed light. 3 dB of squeezing is measured up to 3 THz of sideband frequency with an optical spectrum analyzer. Furthermore, we demonstrate the phase-locking and dispersion compensation of the broadband continuous-wave squeezed light, so that the phase of the squeezed light is maintained over 1 THz.

Here, we report the deterministic switching of chiral antiferromagnetic orders induced by charge current at zero external magnetic field in the van der Waals (vdW) magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide CoTa3S6. This system exhibits strong interactions between cobalt atom magnetic moment lattice and itinerant electrons within the metallic layers, as demonstrated by temperature-dependent angle-resolved photoemission, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and topological Nernst effect measurements. Notably, the itinerant-localization interactions lead to current-induced chiral spin orbit torques as well as Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange torques that interact with the localized magnetic moments, facilitating all-electrical switching of the chiral magnetic order in the CoTa3S6 flake.

Here we demonstrate that symmetry protected three-dimensional topological states can be engineered in an all-dielectric platform with the electromagnetic duality between electric and magnetic fields ensured by the structure design. Magneto-electric coupling playing the role of a synthetic gauge field leads to a topological transition to an insulating regime with a complete three-dimensional photonic bandgap. An emergence of surface states with conical Dirac dispersion and spin-locking is unimpeded. Robust propagation of surface states along two-dimensional domain walls defined by the reversal of magneto-electric coupling is confirmed numerically by first principle studies. It is shown that the proposed system represents a table-top platform for emulating relativistic physics of massive Dirac fermions and the surface states revealed can be interpreted as Jackiw-Rebbi states confined to the interface between two domains with opposite particle masses.","physics.optics,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci",2016,human

The physical properties of embedded NLCs can be manipulated with the application of external stimuli, enabling reconfigurable optical metasurfaces. We report all-optical, dynamic control of the metalens optical response resulting from thermo-plasmonic induced changes of the NLC solution associated with the nematic-isotropic phase transition. A continuous and reversible tuning of the metalens focal length is experimentally demonstrated, with a variation of 80 um (0.16% of the 5 cm nominal focal length) along the optical axis.

To overcome this limitation, resonant structures with high spatial and spectral confinement are carefully designed to enhance the stored electromagnetic energy, thereby requiring lower excitation power to achieve significant nonlinear effects. Small mode-volume and high quality (Q)-factor cavities also offer an efficient coherent control of the light field and the targeted optical properties. Here, we report on optical resonances reaching Q - 10^5 induced by disorder on novel photonic/phononic crystal waveguides. At relatively low excitation powers (below 1 mW), these cavities exhibit nonlinear effects leading to periodic (up to - 35 MHz) oscillations of their resonant wavelength.

We experimentally show the reduction of cross-talk by greater than 30 times and the bending loss by greater than 3 times in densely integrated, ultra-compact photonic circuit blocks. Our prototype all-dielectric metamaterial-waveguide achieves a low propagation loss of approximately 3.7 dB/cm, comparable to those of silicon strip waveguides. Our approach marks a departure from interference-based confinement as in photonic crystals or slot waveguides, which utilize nanoscale field enhancement.

In this work, we systematically studied the band alignment and heterointerface quality in n-MoS2 channel heterostructure TFETs. By selecting a p+-MoS2 source with a sufficiently high doping level, stable gate modulation to a type III band alignment was achieved regardless of the number of MoS2 channel layers. For the gate stack formation, it was found that the deposition of Al2O3 as the top gate introduces defect states for the generation current under reverse bias, while the integration of an h-BN top gate provides a defect-free, clean interface, resulting in the BTBT dominant current even at RT.

This paper introduces MPerceiver: a novel multimodal prompt learning approach that harnesses Stable Diffusion (SD) priors to enhance adaptiveness, generalizability and fidelity for all-in-one image restoration. Specifically, we develop a dual-branch module to master two types of SD prompts: textual for holistic representation and visual for multiscale detail representation. Both prompts are dynamically adjusted by degradation predictions from the CLIP image encoder, enabling adaptive responses to diverse unknown degradations. Moreover, a plug-in detail refinement module improves restoration fidelity via direct encoder-to-decoder information transformation. To assess our method, MPerceiver is trained on 9 tasks for all-in-one IR and outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific methods across most tasks.

Semicoherent searches are a widely-used method of maximizing sensitivity to gravitational-wave pulsars at fixed computing cost: the data from a gravitational-wave detector are partitioned into a number of segments, each segment is coherently analyzed, and the analysis results from each segment are summed together. The generation of template banks for the coherent analysis of each segment, and for the summation, requires knowledge of the metrics associated with the coherent and semicoherent parameter spaces respectively. We present a useful approximation to the semicoherent parameter-space metric, analogous to that presented in Wette and Prix [Phys. Rev. D 88, 123005 (2013)] for the coherent metric.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14472v2,Not All Tasks Are Equally Difficult: Multi-Task Deep Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Depth Routing,"Multi-task reinforcement learning endeavors to accomplish a set of different tasks with a single policy. To enhance data efficiency by sharing parameters across multiple tasks, a common practice segments the network into distinct modules and trains a routing network to recombine these modules into task-specific policies. However, existing routing approaches employ a fixed number of modules for all tasks, neglecting that tasks with varying difficulties commonly require varying amounts of knowledge. This work presents a Dynamic Depth Routing (D2R) framework, which learns strategic skipping of certain intermediate modules, thereby flexibly choosing different numbers of modules for each task. Under this framework, we further introduce a ResRouting method to address the issue of disparate routing paths between behavior and target policies during off-policy training. In addition, we design an automatic route-balancing mechanism to encourage continued routing exploration for unmastered tasks without disturbing the routing of mastered ones. We conduct extensive experiments on various robotics manipulation tasks in the Meta-World benchmark, where D2R achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved learning efficiency.",cs.AI,2023,human

To address this challenge, we introduce FuncBind, a framework based on computer vision to generate target-conditioned, all-atom molecules across atomic systems. FuncBind uses neural fields to represent molecules as continuous atomic densities and employs score-based generative models with modern architectures adapted from the computer vision literature. This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures. FuncBind also generated in vitro novel antibody binders via de novo redesign of the complementarity-determining region H3 loop of two chosen co-crystal structures. As a final contribution, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for structure-conditioned macrocyclic peptide generation.

Although intermixing at the junction of two materials is a widely occurring phenomenon, its influence on material characterization and the estimation of spin-to-charge conversion efficiencies is easily neglected or underestimated. Here, we demonstrate all electrical spin-to-charge conversion in Bi$_x$Se$_{1-x}$ nanodevices and show how the conversion efficiency can be overestimated by tens of times depending on the adjacent metal used as a contact. We attribute this to the intermixing-induced compositional change and the properties of a polycrystal that lead to drastic changes in resistivity and spin Hall angle. Strategies to improve the spin-to-charge conversion signal in similar structures for functional devices are discussed.",cond-mat.mes-hall,2022,human

Such events - ``Galactic Gamma-Ray Bursters'' (GGRBs) - are proposed to cause cosmological gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in other galaxies when their beamed radiation happens to point in our direction. Our hypothesis naturally explains some observations which are difficult to understand with the currently popular ideas about CR origin - e.g. the small Galacto-centric gradient of the cosmic-ray density and the absence of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff. Our idea stands or falls with the existence of the ``hot spots'' (``GGRB remnants'') in the Galactic halo.

Material waves are treated explicitly, while acoustic waves are treated implicitly, thus avoiding severe CFL restrictions for low Mach flows. High order accuracy in time is obtained by semi-implicit temporal integrator based on the IMEX Runge-Kutta (IMEX-RK) framework. High order in space is achieved by finite difference WENO schemes with characteristic-wise reconstructions adapted to the semi-implicit IMEX-RK time discretization. Type A IMEX schemes are constructed to handle not well-prepared initial conditions. Besides, these schemes are proven to be asymptotic preserving and asymptotically accurate as the Mach number vanishes for well-prepared initial conditions. Divergence-free property of the time-discrete schemes is proved. The proposed scheme can also well capture discontinuous solutions in the compressible regime, especially for two dimensional Riemann problems.

The Hamiltonian is still changed locally in selected sites where we wish to realize this anyon symmetry. We refer to these selected sites as defect sites in analogy with the usual lattice defects. The operators on the defect sites condense dyons of the toric code and are shown to support states which obey the fusion rules of Ising anyons just as the lattice dislocations thus achieving the transition to the Ising phase from the toric code phase. They can also be introduced in an entire region leading to an idea of non-localized defects.

The scattering pulse plays the role of a short-period undulator in which relativistic electrons oscillate and emit x-ray radiation. To date, most of the working laser-plasma accelerators operate preferably at energies of a few hundreds of MeV and the Compton sources developed so far produce radiation in the range from hundreds of keV to a few MeV. However, for such applications as medical imaging and tomography the relevant energy range is 10-100 keV. In this article, we discuss different scattering geometries for the generation of X-rays in this range. Through numerical simulations, we study the influence of electron beam parameters on the backscattered photons. We find that the spectral bandwidth remains constant for beams of the same emittance regardless of the scattering geometry. A shallow interaction angle of 30 degrees or less seems particularly promising for imaging applications given parameters of existing laser-plasma accelerators.

In this work, we tackle the challenge of designing output-feedback controllers to boost the performance of $\ell_p$-stable discrete-time nonlinear systems while preserving closed-loop stability from external disturbances to input and output channels. Leveraging operator theory and neural network representations, we parametrize the achievable closed-loop maps for a given system and propose novel parametrizations of all $\ell_p$-stabilizing controllers, unifying frameworks such as nonlinear Youla parametrization and internal model control. Contributing to a rapidly growing research line, our approach enables unconstrained optimization exclusively over stabilizing controllers and provides sufficient conditions to ensure robustness against model mismatch. Additionally, our methods reveal that stronger notions of stability can be imposed on the closed-loop maps if disturbance realizations are available after one time step.

We start by considering such amplitudes in the superconformal N=4 gauge theory where the N=4 supersymmetric Ward identities (SWI) guarantee that all MHV amplitudes for all types of external particles are given by the corresponding tree-level result times a universal helicity- and particle-type-independent contribution. In N=2 SQCD the MHV amplitudes differ from those for N=4 for general values of N_f and N_c. However, for N_f=2N_c where the N=2 SQCD is conformal, the N=2 MHV amplitudes (with all external particles in the adjoint representation) are identical to the N=4results. This factorisation at one-loop motivates us to pose a question if there may be a BDS-like factorisation for these amplitudes which also holds at higher orders of perturbation theory in superconformal N=2 theory.","hep-th,hep-ph",2008,human

The propagators, expressed in terms of all-order one-particle-irreducible correlation functions, have a remarkably simple form because of constraints originating from Slavnov-Taylor identities of Becchi-Rouet-Stora symmetry. I also determine the behavior of the propagators in the neighborhood of the poles, and give a simple prescription for the coefficients that generalize (to the case with an arbitrary vector-scalar mixing) the standard $\sqrt{\mathcal{Z}}$ factors of Lehmann, Symanzik and Zimmermann. So obtained generalized $\sqrt{\mathcal{Z}}$ factors, are indispensable to the correct extraction of physical amplitudes from the amputated correlation functions in the presence of mixing. The standard $R_ξ$ guauges form a particularly important subclass of gauges considered in this paper. While the tree-level vector-scalar mixing is, by construction, absent in $R_ξ$ gauges, it unavoidably reappears at higher orders. Therefore the prescription for the generalized $\sqrt{\mathcal{Z}}$ factors given in this paper is directly relevant for the extraction of amplitudes in $R_ξ$ gauges.","hep-ph,hep-th",2019,human

We outline in detail how effective gauge invariant three boson vertices can be constructed, with all three incoming momenta {\it off--shell}. Explicit closed expressions for the vertices $γW^- W^+$, $Z W^- W^+$, and $χW^- W^+$ are reported. The three boson vertices so constructed satisfy naive QED--like Ward identities which relate them to the gauge invariant gauge boson self--energies previously constructed by the same method. The derivation of the aforementioned Ward identities relies on the sole requirement of complete gauge invariance of the S--matrix element considered; in particular, no knowledge of the explicit closed form of the three boson vertices involved is necessary.The validity of one of these Ward identities is demonstrated explicitly, through a detailed diagrammatic one-loop analysis, in the context of three different gauges.",hep-ph,1995,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0609238v1,Constraining black hole masses from stellar kinematics by summing over all possible distribution functions,"When faced with the task of constraining a galaxy's potential given limited stellar kinematical information, what is the best way of treating the galaxy's unknown distribution function (DF)? Using the example of estimating black hole (BH) masses, I argue that the correct approach is to consider all possible DFs for each trial potential, marginalizing the DF using an infinitely divisible prior. Alternative approaches, such as the widely used maximum penalized likelihood method, neglect the huge degeneracies inherent in the problem and simply identify a single, special DF for each trial potential.   Using simulated observations of toy galaxies with realistic amounts of noise, I find that this marginalization procedure yields significantly tighter constraints on BH masses than the conventional maximum-likelihood method, although it does pose a computational challenge which might be solved with the development of a suitable algorithm for massively parallel machines. I show that in practice the conventional maximum-likelihood method yields reliable BH masses with well-defined minima in their chi^2 distributions, contrary to claims made by Valluri, Merritt & Emsellem.",astro-ph,2006,human

Our approach aims to explicitly regularize the distance between the positive and negative samples in a triplet with respect to the anchor-negative distance. As an initial validation, we show that our method (called No Pairs Left Behind [NPLB]) improves upon the traditional and current state-of-the-art triplet objective formulations on standard benchmark datasets. To show the effectiveness and potentials of NPLB on real-world complex data, we evaluate our approach on a large-scale healthcare dataset (UK Biobank), demonstrating that the embeddings learned by our model significantly outperform all other current representations on tested downstream tasks. Additionally, we provide a new model-agnostic single-time health risk definition that, when used in tandem with the learned representations, achieves the most accurate prediction of subjects' future health complications. Our results indicate that NPLB is a simple, yet effective framework for improving existing deep metric learning models, showcasing the potential implications of metric learning in more complex applications, especially in the biological and healthcare domains.","cs.LG,cs.AI",2022,human

Here, we realize OPA-based quantum state tomography in integrated photonics and demonstrate the generation and all-optical Wigner tomography of squeezed vacuum in a nanophotonic circuit. We employ dispersion-engineering to enable the distortion-free propagation of femtosecond pulses and achieve ultrabroad operation bandwidths, effectively lifting the speed restrictions imposed by traditional electronics on quantum measurements with a theoretical maximum clock speed of 6.5 THz. We implement our circuit on thin-film lithium niobate, a platform compatible with a wide variety of active and passive photonic components.

Minimizing the number of templates required to cover the search parameter space, of sky position and frequency evolution, is one important way to reduce the computational cost of a search. We demonstrate a practical algorithm which, for the first time, achieves template placement with a minimal number of templates for an all-sky search, using the reduced supersky parameter-space metric of Wette and Prix [Phys.

We demonstrate how to ensure complete coverage of the parameter space, including in particular at its boundaries. The number of templates generated by the algorithm is compared to theoretical estimates, and to previous predictions by Brady et al. [Phys. Rev. D 57, 2101 (1998)].

Given a publicly known undirected graph, we treat the weights of edges as sensitive information, and two graphs are neighbors if their edge weights differ in one edge by at most one. We obtain efficient algorithms with significantly improved bounds on a broad class of graphs which we refer to as \textit{recursively separable}. In particular, for any $n$-vertex $K_h$-minor-free graph, our algorithm achieve an additive error of $\widetilde{O}(h(nW)^{1/3} ) $, where $ W $ represents the maximum edge weight; For grid graphs, the same algorithmic scheme achieve additive error of $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/4}\sqrt{W})$.   Our approach can be seen as a generalization of the celebrated binary tree mechanism for range queries, as releasing range queries is equivalent to computing all-pair distances on a path graph. In essence, our approach is based on generalizing the binary tree mechanism to graphs that are \textit{recursively separable}.",cs.DS,2025,human

Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs extend traditional Knowledge Graphs by associating an entity with its possible modal representations, including text, images, audio, and videos, all of which are used to convey the semantics of the entity. Despite the increasing attention that Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs have received, there is a lack of consensus about the definitions and modelling of modalities, whose definition is often determined by application domains. In this paper, we propose a novel ontology design pattern that captures the separation of concerns between an entity (and the information it conveys), whose semantics can have different manifestations across different media, and its realisation in terms of a physical information entity. By introducing this abstract model, we aim to facilitate the harmonisation and integration of different existing multi-modal ontologies which is crucial for many intelligent applications across different domains spanning from medicine to digital humanities.",cs.AI,2024,human

The authors conclude that the star formation process is hierarchical and that only a small fraction of stars form in dense star clusters. Here, we show that the peak and the width of the density distribution are also what follow if all stars form in bound clusters which are not significantly affected by the presence of gas and expand by two-body relaxation. The peak of the surface density distribution is simply obtained from the typical ages (few Myr) and cluster membership number (few hundred) typifying nearby star-forming regions. This result depends weakly on initial cluster sizes, provided that they are sufficiently dense (initial half mass radius of <0.3 pc) for dynamical evolution to be important at an age of a few Myr. We conclude that the degeneracy of the YSO surface density distribution complicates its use as a diagnostic of the stellar formation environment.",astro-ph.GA,2012,human

However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.",cs.CL,2024,human

The scheme treats all terms associated with the acoustic pressure implicitly while keeping the remaining terms part of the explicit sub-system. This semi-implicit approach makes the method particularly well suited for problems in the low Mach regime. We combine the semi-implicit scheme with the deviation well-balancing technique and prove that it maintains equilibrium solutions for the magnetohydrostatic case up to rounding errors. In order to preserve the divergence-free property of the magnetic field enforced by the solenoidal constraint, we incorporate a constrained transport method in the semi-implicit framework. Second order of accuracy is achieved by means of a standard spatial reconstruction technique with total variation diminishing (TVD) property, and by an asymptotic preserving (AP) time stepping algorithm built upon the implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta time integrators.

Investigations of ultrafast electron dynamics in atoms, molecules and solids, with potential impact across physics, chemistry, and biology, would benefit significantly from the ability to perform all-attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (AATAS).

Here we introduce a novel all-optical cold damping scheme based on spatial modulation of the trap position that is scalable to multiple particles. The scheme relies on using programmable optical tweezers to provide full independent control over trap frequency and position of each tweezer. We show that the technique cools the center-of-mass motion of particles down to $17\,$mK at a pressure of $2 \times 10^{-6}\,$mbar and demonstrate its scalability by simultaneously cooling the motion of two particles.

Deep learning-based methods have significantly improved image restoration performance, however, they have limited generalization ability to different degradation types and levels.

We present a prompt-based learning approach, PromptIR, for All-In-One image restoration that can effectively restore images from various types and levels of degradation. In particular, our method uses prompts to encode degradation-specific information, which is then used to dynamically guide the restoration network. This allows our method to generalize to different degradation types and levels, while still achieving state-of-the-art results on image denoising, deraining, and dehazing. Overall, PromptIR offers a generic and efficient plugin module with few lightweight prompts that can be used to restore images of various types and levels of degradation with no prior information on the corruptions present in the image.

To handle various weather conditions, an AiO framework is expected to adaptively learn weather-specific knowledge for different degradations and shared knowledge for common patterns. However, existing methods: 1) rely on extra supervision signals, which are usually unknown in real-world applications; 2) employ fixed network structures, which restrict the diversity of weather-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Language-driven Restoration framework (LDR) to alleviate the aforementioned issues. First, we leverage the power of pre-trained vision-language (PVL) models to enrich the diversity of weather-specific knowledge by reasoning about the occurrence, type, and severity of degradation, generating description-based degradation priors. Then, with the guidance of degradation prior, we sparsely select restoration experts from a candidate list dynamically based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure. This enables us to adaptively learn the weather-specific and shared knowledge to handle various weather conditions (e.g., unknown or mixed weather).

To check this possibility, appropriate steady forces and torques were applied in the course of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of DNA with AT- and GC-alternating sequences. It is found that the stretching rigidity grows with tension as well as twisting. The torsional rigidity is not affected by stretching, but it varies with twisting very strongly, and differently for the two sequences. Surprisingly, for AT-alternating DNA it passes through a minimum with the average twist close to the experimental value in solution. For this fragment, but not for the GC-alternating sequence, the bending rigidity noticeably changes with both twisting and stretching.

Many structural features are carried over: for instance, our labeling scheme enables systematic tracking of all couplings when constructing composite amplitudes from simpler building blocks at arbitrary loop orders in perturbation theory. Our analysis provides a transparent understanding of both low-order and all-order zeros of couplings under radiative corrections. Furthermore, we examine the fate of low-order zeros when the fusion algebra is not faithfully realized -- a situation not captured by the vanilla argument of ``loop-induced groupification'' -- and formulate a conjecture on the related aspects of particle decoupling and effective theory. Finally, we discuss the low-order versus all-order zeros in Yukawa textures from the perspective of spurion analysis.","hep-ph,hep-th",2025,human

Counterintuitively, the thermal time dynamics of the system enable simultaneous time integration of ultra-fast (50GHz) signals and the application of programmable, non-linear activation functions, entirely within the optical domain.

In this paper, we derive a generalised Tolman VII solution which includes a charge and a cosmological constant. We analyse the spatial geometry of the solution and present conditions for zero and non-zero spatial curvature. We show that for a particular value of the boundary, the Tolman VII space-time can be matched to the charged Nariai space-time. This represents a new class of interior Nariai solutions. Matching with the Reissner-Nordström-de Sitter space-time, we derive analytic expressions for the metric functions and the pressure. Using this, we show that the solution allows for trapped null geodesics for a broad range of values for the total charge, central density, and the cosmological constant. We investigate the physical properties and derive an equation of state for the fluid. We show that the fluid can be considered a polytrope with, $Γ\sim 2.5$. Finally, we analyse the sound speed and energy conditions to conclude that only a subclass of the solution follows all the basic physical acceptability criteria.",gr-qc,2024,human

The rapid increase of functional glycan data provides a good opportunity for machine learning solutions to glycan understanding. However, there still lacks a standard machine learning benchmark for glycan property and function prediction. In this work, we fill this blank by building a comprehensive benchmark for Glycan Machine Learning (GlycanML). The GlycanML benchmark consists of diverse types of tasks including glycan taxonomy prediction, glycan immunogenicity prediction, glycosylation type prediction, and protein-glycan interaction prediction. Glycans can be represented by both sequences and graphs in GlycanML, which enables us to extensively evaluate sequence-based models and graph neural networks (GNNs) on benchmark tasks. Furthermore, by concurrently performing eight glycan taxonomy prediction tasks, we introduce the GlycanML-MTL testbed for multi-task learning (MTL) algorithms. Also, we evaluate how taxonomy prediction can boost other three function prediction tasks by MTL. Experimental results show the superiority of modeling glycans with multi-relational GNNs, and suitable MTL methods can further boost model performance.

Despite this, many representation learning approaches restrict themselves to modeling smaller systems or use coarse-grained approximations of the systems, for example modeling proteins at the resolution of amino acid residues rather than at the level of individual atoms. To address this, we develop quantized auto-encoders that learn atom-level tokenizations of complete proteins, RNA and small molecule structures with reconstruction accuracies well below 1 Angstrom. We demonstrate that a simple Mamba state space model architecture is efficient compared to an SE(3)-invariant IPA architecture, reaches competitive accuracies and can scale to systems with almost 100,000 atoms. The learned structure tokens of bio2token may serve as the input for all-atom generative models in the future.","cs.LG,cs.AI",2024,human

In the model formulations, both nonlinear eigenvalue problem and total energy minimization problem pursue orthogonal solutions. Most existing algorithms for solving these two models invoke orthogonalization process either explicitly or implicitly in each iteration. Their efficiency suffers from this process in view of its cubic complexity and low parallel scalability in terms of the number of electrons for large scale systems. To break through this bottleneck, we propose an orthogonalization-free algorithm framework based on the total energy minimization problem. It is shown that the desired orthogonality can be gradually achieved without invoking orthogonalization in each iteration. Moreover, this framework fully consists of Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) operations and thus can be naturally parallelized. The global convergence of the proposed algorithm is established. We also present a precondition technique which can dramatically accelerate the convergence of the algorithm.

Moreover, in several asymptotically-optimal algorithms these NN queries are of a specific form: Given a set of points and a radius r report all pairs of points whose distance is at most r. This calls for an application-specific NN data structure tailored to efficiently answering this type of queries. Randomly transformed grids (RTG) were recently proposed by Aiger et al. as a tool to answer such queries and have been shown to outperform common implementations of NN data structures in this context. In this work we employ RTG for sampling-based motion-planning algorithms and describe an efficient implementation of the approach. We show that for motion-planning, RTG allow for faster convergence to high-quality solutions when compared with existing NN data structures. Additionally, RTG enable significantly shorter construction times for batched-PRM variants; specifically, we demonstrate a speedup by a factor of two to three for some scenarios.",cs.RO,2014,human

The Relative Kolchin Theorem allows subgroups H whose elements have exponential growth, as long as all such exponential growth is cordoned off in some free factor system F which is invariant under every element of H. The conclusion is that a certain finite index subgroup of H has an invariant filtration by free factor systems going from F up to the full free factor system by individual steps each of which is a ""one-edge extension"".

However, we may exploit the one-loop dominance for the effective action and obtain various observables to all orders from one-loop calculation by simply shifting the center of expansion to the ``quantum solution'', which extremizes the effective action. We confirm the validity of this method by comparison with the direct two-loop calculation and with Monte Carlo results in the 3d Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons matrix model. From the all order result we find that the perturbative expansion has a finite radius of convergence.","hep-th,hep-lat",2004,human

These systems often suffer from destructive interference at the destination node due to uncoordinated transmissions of common packets by cooperating UAVs. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of virtual transmit channels at each UAV, implemented using truncated all-pass filters (APFs). This approach ensures that all subcarriers benefit from comparable transmit powers, guaranteeing excellent performance when a single UAV is transmitting. In scenarios where multiple UAVs cooperate without coordination, the inherent randomness of the generated virtual channels facilitates cooperative diversity, effectively mitigating destructive interference. We further integrate this method with the distributed randomized space-time block coding (STBC) scheme to enhance transmission reliability. Additionally, we propose efficient algorithms for estimating the composite channels that combine both the true propagation channels and the virtual channels.

It is therefore important to make efficient use of available computational resources, notably by minimizing the number of templates used to cover the signal parameter space of sky position and frequency evolution. For searches over the sky, however, the required template density (determined by the parameter-space metric) is different at each sky position, which makes it difficult in practice to achieve an efficient covering. Previous work on this problem has found various choices of sky and frequency coordinates that render the parameter-space metric approximately constant, but which are limited to coherent integration times of either less than a few days, or greater than several months. These limitations restrict the sensitivity achievable by hierarchical all-sky searches, and hinder the development of follow-up pipelines for interesting gravitational-wave pulsar candidates. We present a new flat parameter-space metric approximation, and associated sky and frequency coordinates, that do not suffer from these limitations. Furthermore, the new metric is numerically well-conditioned, which facilitates its practical use.",gr-qc,2013,human

When the amplification factor exceeds a certain threshold, the scrambler system exhibits chaotical behavior. A commercial single wavelength laser with linewidth of 3 MHz is utilized to characterize the scrambling performance. We found that when the sampling rate is 1.6 MSa/s, a scrambling speed up to 2000 krad/s can be obtained for the average degree of polarization being less than 0.1.

Magnetometry measurements at different temperatures show that the transition from the ferromagnetic to the antiferromagnetic coupling at zero field is observed at $\sim$325K.

The resulting catalog provides precise positions, sub-arcsecond structures, and spectral indices for some 11,000 sources. We describe the morphology and spectral index distribution of the sample and comment on the survey's power to select several classes of interesting sources, especially high energy blazars.

After generating a suitable ensemble of starting conformations at high temperatures, at room temperature in an adaptive box algorithm we have generated histograms for the radius of gyration, secondary structure time series, generated model small angle x-ray scattering intensities, and model chemical shift plots for comparison to nuclear magnetic resonance data for solvated and filamentous tau. Significantly, we find that the chemical shift spectrum is more consistent with filamentous tau than full length solution based tau. We have also carried out principle component analysis and find three basics groups: compact globules, tadpoles, and extended hinging structures. To validate the adaptive box and our force field choice, we have run limited simulations in a large conventional box with varying force fields and find that our essential results are unchanged.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06709v1,Review Learning: Advancing All-in-One Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration Training Method,"All-in-one image restoration tasks are becoming increasingly important, especially for ultra-high-definition (UHD) images. Existing all-in-one UHD image restoration methods usually boost the model's performance by introducing prompt or customized dynamized networks for different degradation types. For the inference stage, it might be friendly, but in the training stage, since the model encounters multiple degraded images of different quality in an epoch, these cluttered learning objectives might be information pollution for the model. To address this problem, we propose a new training paradigm for general image restoration models, which we name \textbf{Review Learning}, which enables image restoration models to be capable enough to handle multiple types of degradation without prior knowledge and prompts. This approach begins with sequential training of an image restoration model on several degraded datasets, combined with a review mechanism that enhances the image restoration model's memory for several previous classes of degraded datasets. In addition, we design a lightweight all-purpose image restoration network that can efficiently reason about degraded images with 4K ($3840 \times 2160$) resolution on a single consumer-grade GPU.",cs.CV,2024,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05076v1,Matter dependence of the four-loop QCD cusp anomalous dimension: from small angles to all angles,"We compute the fermionic contributions to the cusp anomalous dimension in QCD at four loops as an expansion for small cusp angle. As a byproduct we also obtain the respective terms of the four-loop HQET wave function anomalous dimension. Our new results at small angles provide stringent tests of a recent conjecture for the exact angle dependence of the matter terms in the four-loop cusp anomalous dimension. We find that the conjecture does not hold for two of the seven fermionic color structures, but passes all tests for the remaining terms. This provides strong support for the validity of the corresponding conjectured expressions with full angle dependence. Taking the limit of large Minkowskian angle, we extract novel analytic results for certain terms of the light-like cusp anomalous dimension. They agree with the known numerical results. Finally, we study the anti-parallel lines limit of the cusp anomalous dimension. In a conformal theory, the latter is proportional to the static quark-antiquark potential. We use the new four-loop results to determine parts of the conformal anomaly term.","hep-ph,hep-th",2019,human

Unlike existing marching methods that rely on approximate discretized solutions to the Eikonal equation, our approach achieves exact wavefront propagation by pivoting the analytic distance function based on visibility. The algorithm leverages a dynamic-programming subroutine to efficiently evaluate visibility queries. Through benchmarking against state-of-the-art any-angle path planners, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both speed and accuracy, particularly in cluttered environments. Notably, our method inherently provides globally optimal paths to all grid points, eliminating the need for additional gradient descent steps per path query. The same capability extends to multiple starting positions. We also provide a greedy version of our algorithm as well as open-source C++ implementation of our solver.","cs.RO,cs.CG",2024,human

A Hierarchical Look into Multi-Agent Error Attribution,"Error attribution in Large Language Model (LLM) multi-agent systems presents a significant challenge in debugging and improving collaborative AI systems. Current approaches to pinpointing agent and step level failures in interaction traces - whether using all-at-once evaluation, step-by-step analysis, or binary search - fall short when analyzing complex patterns, struggling with both accuracy and consistency. We present ECHO (Error attribution through Contextual Hierarchy and Objective consensus analysis), a novel algorithm that combines hierarchical context representation, objective analysis-based evaluation, and consensus voting to improve error attribution accuracy. Our approach leverages a positional-based leveling of contextual understanding while maintaining objective evaluation criteria, ultimately reaching conclusions through a consensus mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods across various multi-agent interaction scenarios, showing particular strength in cases involving subtle reasoning errors and complex interdependencies. Our findings suggest that leveraging these concepts of structured, hierarchical context representation combined with consensus-based objective decision-making, provides a more robust framework for error attribution in multi-agent systems.","cs.AI,cs.MA",2025,human

Recent work in the field has been to look for architectures subject to multiple objectives such as accuracy and latency to efficiently deploy them on different target hardware. Once-for-All (OFA) is one such method that decouples training and search and is able to find high-performance networks for different latency constraints. However, the search phase is inefficient at incorporating multiple latency targets. In this paper, we introduce two strategies (Top-down and Bottom-up) that use warm starting and randomized network pruning for the efficient incorporation of multiple latency targets in the OFA network. We evaluate these strategies against the current OFA implementation and demonstrate that our strategies offer significant running time performance gains while not sacrificing the accuracy of the subnetworks that were found for each latency target. We further demonstrate that these performance gains are generalized to every design space used by the OFA network.",cs.LG,2020,human

In addition to its practical utility, T-NER facilitates the study and investigation of the cross-domain and cross-lingual generalization ability of LMs finetuned on NER. Our library also provides a web app where users can get model predictions interactively for arbitrary text, which facilitates qualitative model evaluation for non-expert programmers. We show the potential of the library by compiling nine public NER datasets into a unified format and evaluating the cross-domain and cross-lingual performance across the datasets. The results from our initial experiments show that in-domain performance is generally competitive across datasets. However, cross-domain generalization is challenging even with a large pretrained LM, which has nevertheless capacity to learn domain-specific features if fine-tuned on a combined dataset.

The scheme differs from the classical two-beam Bell-Bloom scheme in that the detecting laser beam is split into two beams, which are introduced into the cell in orthogonal directions, and the ratio of the amplitudes of the magnetic resonance signals in these beams and their phase difference are measured; strong optical pumping from the lower hyperfine level of the ground state ensures the resonance line narrowing, and detection in two beams is carried out in a balanced schemes by measuring the beam polarization rotation. The proposed sensor is compact, resistant to variations of parameters of laser radiation and highly sensitive to the angle of deflection of the magnetic field vector - with an estimated scalar sensitivity of the order of 16 fT/Hz1/2 in 8x8x8 mm3 cell, an angular sensitivity of 4x10-7 rad, or 0.08'', was demonstrated.","physics.optics,physics.app-ph,physics.med-ph,quant-ph",2023,human

Consequently, PDC can only be achieved for a particular combination of geometric parameters of the metamaterial, and hence is sensitive to fabrication imperfections. These fabrication imperfections may limit the usefulness in practical applications.

AIRI closely tracks with the spatial extent of wet anomalies and with the average across gridpoints in rainy day count. The leading rainfall variability mode is a monopole associated primarily with rainy day count and ENSO. The second mode is a tripole with same-signed loadings in the high-rainfall Western Ghats and Central Monsoon Zone regions and opposite-signed loadings in Southeastern India between. The IOD projects onto this tripole and, as such, is weakly correlated with AIRI. However, when the linear influence of ENSO is removed, the IOD rainfall regressions become quasi-homogeneously more positive, making the ENSO-residual IOD and AIRI timeseries significantly correlated.",physics.ao-ph,2021,human

In particular, by taking advantage of the large Kerr coefficient of graphene, the index of refraction of a topologically-protected graphene metasurface can be tuned via a pump beam, which results in an optically controllable frequency shift of the photonic bands of the metasurface. This spectral variation can in turn be readily employed to control and switch the propagation of an optical signal in certain waveguide modes of the graphene metasurface. Importantly, our theoretical and computational analysis reveals that the threshold pump power needed to optically switch ON/OFF the signal is strongly dependent on the group velocity of the pump mode, especially when the device is operated in the slow-light regime. This study could open up new routes towards active photonic nanodevices whose underlying functionality stems from their topological characteristics.","physics.optics,cond-mat.mes-hall",2023,human

The theory developed in this paper only requires the practical degrees of over-parameterization unlike previous theories. Our theory only requires the number of trainable parameters to increase linearly as the number of training samples increases. This allows the size of the deep neural networks to be consistent with practice and to be several orders of magnitude smaller than that required by the previous theories. Moreover, we prove that the linear increase of the size of the network is the optimal rate and that it cannot be improved, except by a logarithmic factor. Furthermore, deep neural networks with the trainability guarantee are shown to generalize well to unseen test samples with a natural dataset but not a random dataset.","stat.ML,cs.LG,cs.NE,math.OC",2019,human

Thin films were deposited via pulsed laser deposition and their electrical properties were compared with ceramic pellets. A detailed characterization of the micro structure shows that thin films can be deposited fully crystalline at higher temperatures but also partially amorphous at room temperature. The conductivity is not strongly influenced by the presence of grain boundaries, exposure to air or lithium deficiencies. First-principles molecular dynamics simulations were employed to calculate the lithium ion diffusion profile and the conductivity at various temperatures of the ideal LGPO crystal. Simulations gives the upper limit of conductivity for a defect free crystal, which is in the range of 10-2 S cm-1 at 300 deg. The ease of thin film fabrication, the room-temperature Li-ion conductivity in the range of a few microS cm-1 make LGPO a very appealing electrolyte material for thin film all-solid-state all-oxide microbatteries.","cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.app-ph",2020,human

Traditional FL relies on a server-client (SC) architecture, where a central server coordinates multiple clients to train a global model, but this approach faces scalability challenges due to server communication bottlenecks. To overcome this, the ring-all-reduce (RAR) architecture has been introduced, eliminating the central server and achieving bandwidth optimality. However, the tightly coupled nature of RAR's ring topology exposes it to unique Byzantine attack risks not present in SC-based FL. Despite its potential, designing Byzantine-robust RAR-based FL algorithms remains an open problem. To address this gap, we propose BRACE (Byzantine-robust ring-all-reduce), the first RAR-based FL algorithm to achieve both Byzantine robustness and communication efficiency. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of BRACE under Byzantine attacks, demonstrate its bandwidth efficiency, and validate its practical effectiveness through experiments.

Specifically, we leverage simultaneous usage of nanostructured subwavelength metamaterial waveguides and excitation of standing wave rather than traveling wave whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonances. This enables the mode volume to be reduced by factors greater than 10 to 100 compared to a diffraction-limited silicon microring resonator. We also highlight how a combination of diffractive mode volume scaling and sub-diffractive near-field intensity scaling indicates a lower limit for the sub-diffractive all-dielectric mode volume, $V_{\text{min}}'$, which scales in proportion to the mode order times the refractive index raised to the seventh power, i.e., $V_{\text{min}}' \sim m n^{-7}$. Through both numerical modeling and experimental characterization, we systematically investigate the modal properties of metawaveguide ring resonators comprised of Si and SiO$_2$. The sub-diffractive devices are experimentally shown to support standing wave resonances with high intrinsic quality factors, on the order of $10^4$ to $10^5$. These metamaterial ring resonators present a promising WGM platform for interfacing wavelength-scale optics with sub-wavelength matter.",physics.optics,2024,human

Existing approaches typically rely on Degradation-specific models or coarse-grained degradation prompts to guide image restoration. However, they lack fine-grained modeling of degradation information and face limitations in balancing multi-task conflicts. To overcome these limitations, we propose DPMambaIR, a novel All-in-One image restoration framework that introduces a fine-grained degradation extractor and a Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model (DP-SSM). The DP-SSM leverages the fine-grained degradation features captured by the extractor as dynamic prompts, which are then incorporated into the state space modeling process. This enhances the model's adaptability to diverse degradation types, while a complementary High-Frequency Enhancement Block (HEB) recovers local high-frequency details. Extensive experiments on a mixed dataset containing seven degradation types show that DPMambaIR achieves the best performance, with 27.69dB and 0.893 in PSNR and SSIM, respectively. These results highlight the potential and superiority of DPMambaIR as a unified solution for All-in-One image restoration.",cs.CV,2025,human

In this paper, a compact all-fibre label-free nano-sensor composed of a fibre taper and zinc oxide nano-gratings is designed and applied for the early monitoring of apoptosis in single living cells. Because of its nanoscale dimensions, mechanical flexibility and minimal cytotoxicity to cells, the sensing module can be loaded in cells for long-term in situ tracking with high sensitivity. A gradual increase in the nuclear refractive index during the apoptosis process is observed, revealing the increase in molecular density and the decrease in cell volume. The strategy used in this study not only contributes to the understanding of internal environmental variations during cellular apoptosis but also provides a new platform for non-fluorescent all-fibre devices to investigate cellular events and to promote new progress in fundamental cell biochemical engineering.","physics.optics,q-bio.CB",2021,human

In this work, we present a new effect induced by the electronic Berry curvature. By studying electron-phonon interactions in BaMnSb$_2$, a prototype two-dimensional Dirac material possessing two TR-related massive Dirac cones, we find that the nonzero local Berry curvature of electrons can induce a phonon angular momentum. The direction of this phonon angular momentum is locked to the phonon propagation direction, and thus we refer it as ""phonon helicity"", in a way that is reminiscent of electron helicity in spin-orbit-coupled electronic systems. We discuss possible experimental probes of such phonon helicity.","cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci",2021,human

In this paper, we show that by introducing non-Hermitian perturbation into the system with loss and gain constituents, the high-quality resonances known as trapped modes can be excited without the need to change the symmetry of the unit cell geometry. To demonstrate this idea, we consider a widely used all-dielectric planar metamaterial whose unit cell consists of a pair of rectangular nanoantennas made of ordinal (with loss) and doped (with gain) silicon. Since the quality factor of the trapped-mode resonance can be controlled by changing both spatial symmetry and non-Hermiticity, varying loss and gain allows us to compensate for the influence of asymmetry and restore the quality factor of the localized mode. The results obtained suggest new ways to achieve high-quality resonances in non-Hermitian metamaterials promising for many practical applications in nanophotonics.",physics.optics,2022,human

However, Ohmic loss limits the achievable Q-factors in conventional plasmonic EIT metasurfaces to values less than 10, significantly hampering device performance. Here, we report experimental demonstration of a classical analogue of EIT using all-dielectric silicon-based metasurfaces. Due to extremely low absorption loss and coherent interaction of neighboring meta-atoms, a record-high Q-factor of 483 is experimentally observed, leading to a refractive index sensor with a figure-of-merit (FOM) of 103.

The all-optical magnetic switching under both single pulse and multiple-pulse sequences can be achieved at room temperature, in narrow spectral ranges with light polarized either along <110> or <100> crystallographic axes of the garnet.

The enhanced high harmonics are highly anisotropic with excitation polarization and are selective to excitation wavelength due to its resonant feature.

Unlike existing methods that rely on task-specific models or ambiguous text-based priors, Defusion constructs explicit \textbf{visual instructions} that align with the visual degradation patterns. These instructions are grounded by applying degradations to standardized visual elements, capturing intrinsic degradation features while agnostic to image semantics. Defusion then uses these visual instructions to guide a diffusion-based model that operates directly in the degradation space, where it reconstructs high-quality images by denoising the degradation effects with enhanced stability and generalizability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Defusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse image restoration tasks, including complex and real-world degradations.",cs.CV,2025,human

Moreover, we observe the switching at room temperature in samples that are immune to external magnetic fields in excess of 1 T, provided they exhibit compensation above room temperature. Observations of the effect in compensated ferrimagnets without Gd challenges our understanding of all-optical switching. The dynamic behavior indicates that Mn2RuxGa switches in 2 ps or less.

Here we realize the most basic unit of such a photonic circuit: a single-photon activated switch, capable of routing a photon from any of its two inputs to any of its two outputs. Our device is based on a single 87Rb atom coupled to a fiber-coupled, chip-based microresonator, and is completely all-optical, requiring no other fields beside the in-fiber single-photon pulses. Nonclassical statistics of the control pulse confirm that a single reflected photon toggles the switch from high reflection (65%) to high transmission (90%), with average of ~1.5 control photons per switching event (~3 including linear losses). The fact that the control and target photons are both in-fiber and practically identical makes this scheme compatible with scalable architectures for quantum information processing.","quant-ph,physics.atom-ph,physics.optics",2014,human

This paper proposes a simple pipeline for all-in-one blind image restoration to Restore Anything with Masks (RAM). We focus on the image content by utilizing Mask Image Modeling to extract intrinsic image information rather than distinguishing degradation types like other methods. Our pipeline consists of two stages: masked image pre-training and fine-tuning with mask attribute conductance. We design a straightforward masking pre-training approach specifically tailored for all-in-one image restoration. This approach enhances networks to prioritize the extraction of image content priors from various degradations, resulting in a more balanced performance across different restoration tasks and achieving stronger overall results. To bridge the gap of input integrity while preserving learned image priors as much as possible, we selectively fine-tuned a small portion of the layers. Specifically, the importance of each layer is ranked by the proposed Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC), and the layers with higher contributions are selected for finetuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

The experimental signatures of quantum vacuum nonlinearities are encoded in signal photons, whose kinematic and polarization properties differ from the photons constituting the macroscopic laser fields. We implement an efficient numerical algorithm allowing for the theoretical investigation of such signatures in realistic field configurations accessible in experiment. This algorithm is based on a vacuum emission scheme and can readily be adapted to the collision of more laser beams or further involved field configurations. We solve the case of two colliding pulses in full 3+1 dimensional spacetime, and identify experimental geometries and parameter regimes with improved signal-to-noise ratios.","hep-ph,hep-th,quant-ph",2017,human

The model was trained using descriptors related to the mean properties of individual atoms, the properties of simple compounds in their ground state, and measures of chemical disorder. It demonstrated high accuracy in predicting structural properties, while exhibiting moderate accuracy in predicting magnetic properties. To identify optimal alloy compositions, a genetic algorithm was used to find those with the greatest differences in magnetization during martensitic transitions. Using this combined approach, the Ni-Co-Mn-Ti alloy system was thoroughly explored, resulting in the discovery of an alloy with a maximum magnetization difference. These results are consistent with previous research based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) and highlight the effectiveness of integrating machine learning with genetic algorithms for the discovery of new materials with outstanding magnetocaloric properties. The study emphasizes the need for further refinement of models capable of accurately predicting complex magnetic interactions, which is essential for fully leveraging the potential of all-d-metal Heusler alloys in practical applications.",cond-mat.mtrl-sci,2024,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06458v2,Pruning All-Rounder: Rethinking and Improving Inference Efficiency for Large Vision Language Models,"Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results, their high computational costs pose a significant barrier to wide application. To enhance inference efficiency, most existing approaches can be categorized as parameter-dependent or token-dependent strategies to reduce computational demands. However, parameter-dependent methods require retraining LVLMs to recover performance while token-dependent strategies struggle to consistently select the most relevant tokens. In this paper, we systematically analyze the above challenges and provide a series of valuable insights for inference acceleration. Based on these findings, we propose a novel framework, the Pruning All-Rounder (PAR). Different from previous works, PAR develops a meta-router to adaptively organize pruning flows across both tokens and layers. With a self-supervised learning manner, our method achieves a superior balance between performance and efficiency. Notably, PAR is highly flexible, offering multiple pruning versions to address a range of acceleration scenarios.

In this work, we discuss the opportunities enabled by the interaction of dielectric nanoresonators with 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs), leading to weak and strong coupling regimes. We perform a comprehensive analysis of bright exciton photoluminescence (PL) enhancement from various 2D TMDCs, including WS2, MoS2, WSe2, and MoSe2 via their coupling to Mie resonances of a silicon nanoparticle. For each case, we find the system parameters corresponding to maximal PL enhancement taking into account excitation rate, Purcell factor, and radiation efficiency. We demonstrate numerically that all-dielectric Si nanoantennas can significantly enhance the PL intensity from 2D TMDC by a factor of hundred through precise optimization of the geometrical and material parameters. Our results may be useful for high-efficiency 2D TMDC-based optoelectronic, nanophotonic, and quantum optical devices.",physics.optics,2018,human

Here we show, based on rigorous first-principles calculations, that the spin properties can be manipulated and detected in molecular spinterfaces, where an iron tetraphenyl porphyrin (FeTPP) molecule is deposited on boron-substituted graphene (B-G). Notably, a reversible spin switching between the $S=1$ and $S=3/2$ states is achieved by a gate electrode. We can trace the origin to a strong hybridization between the Fe-$d_{{z}^2}$ and B-$p_z$ orbitals. Combining density functional theory with nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we propose an experimentally feasible 3-terminal setup to probe the spin state. Furthermore, we show how the in-plane quantum transport for the B-G, which is non-spin polarized, can be modified by FeTPP, yielding a significant transport spin polarization near the Fermi energy ($>10\%$ for typical coverage).

The film is formed on a piezoelectric substrate between two interdigital transducers (IDT), a platform often used to construct a surface acoustic wave device. With the substrate piezoelectricity, strain is induced into the film by applying a dc voltage to the IDTs. The strain causes changes in the magnetization direction of the magnetic layer, which is probed by measuring changes, if any, in the transverse resistance of the heterostructure. We find the extracted magnetoelastic coupling constant of the magnetic layer (CoFeB) depends on the film stacking. Such change can be accounted for provided that the elastic properties of the layers that constitute the heterostructures are taken into account. The on-chip all-electrical approach described here provides a versatile means to quantitatively assess the magnetoelastic coupling constant of thin film heterostructures.","cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci",2023,human

While the AFASS maps are absolutely calibrated against large-scale diffuse emission, it was uncertain whether or not an additional flux correction for point sources was necessary. Here, we verify that calibration for point-source photometry in the AFASS maps is proper. With the aperture correction method based on the empirical point-spread-function templates derived directly from the AFASS maps, fluxes in the AKARI bright source catalogue (BSC) are reproduced. The AKARI BSC fluxes are also satisfactorily recovered with the 1 sigma aperture, which is the empirical equivalent of an infinite aperture. These results confirm that in the AFASS maps far-IR photometry can be properly performed by using the aperture correction method for point sources and by summing all pixel values within an appropriately defined aperture of the intended target (i.e., the aperture photometry method) for extended sources.","astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.GA",2018,human

It consists of two stages, place recognition and pose estimation, which yields the current orientation and translation, using only the current scan as query and a database of map scans. Inspired by the definition of a recognized place, we consider that a good global localization solution should keep the pose estimation accuracy with a lower place density. Following this idea, we propose a novel framework towards sparse place-based global localization, which utilizes a unified and learning-free representation, Radon sinogram (RING), for all sub-tasks. Based on the theoretical derivation, a translation invariant descriptor and an orientation invariant metric are proposed for place recognition, achieving certifiable robustness against arbitrary orientation and large translation between query and map scan. In addition, we also utilize the property of RING to propose a global convergent solver for both orientation and translation estimation, arriving at global localization. Evaluation of the proposed RING based framework validates the feasibility and demonstrates a superior performance even under a lower place density.",cs.RO,2022,human

All-optical magnetization reversal of perpendicularly magnetized thin films can occur if there are sufficient strong spin-Hall, skew scattering, and Rashba interactions. In the presence of spin-orbit interactions, the transient charge currents provide the generation of transverse-spin currents and accumulations, which eventually exert spin-transfer torque on the magnetization. By combining the optically excited spin-dependent diffusive transport with the spin and charge currents due to skew scattering, spin-Hall, inverse spin-Hall and Rashba interactions, into a numerical model, we demonstrate a possibility of ultra-fast all-optical magnetization reversal. This understanding provokes intriguing, more in-depth experimental studies on the role of spin-orbit interaction mechanisms in optimizing structures for all-optical magnetization reversal.",cond-mat.mes-hall,2016,human

To the best of our knowledge, this energy is the highest reported at 1645 nm in an all-fiber laser source. Our method consists in reducing the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) gain for the pump and signal pulses, respectively by sweeping the optical frequency of the pump beam, and by applying a strain gradient on the amplification fiber. This compact laser source is now used in a transportable lidar system to measure simultaneously wind velocity and methane (CH4) concentration.","physics.optics,physics.ao-ph",2020,human

The proposed technique is based on the co-propagation of an arbitrary shaped signal together with an orthogonally polarized intense fast sinusoidal beating within a normally dispersive optical fiber. Basically, the strong nonlinear phase shift induced by the sinusoidal pump beam on the orthogonal weak signal through cross-phase modulation turns the defocusing regime into localized temporal focusing effects. This periodic focusing is then responsible for the generation of a high-repetition-rate temporal comb upon the incident signal whose amplitude is directly proportional to its initial shape. This internal redistribution of energy leads to a simultaneous sampling and magnification of the signal intensity profile. This process allows us to experimentally demonstrate a 40-GHz sampling operation as well as an 8-dB magnification of an arbitrary shaped nanosecond signal around 1550 nm in a 5-km long normally dispersive fiber.

This unconventional photon blockade allows to produce antibunched radiation at extremely low input powers. We demonstrate a reliable protocol to operate this mechanism under pulsed optical excitation, as required for device applications, thus implementing a true single-photon source.

Semi-coherent analyses that attempt to improve sensitivity by coherently combining data from multiple detectors face a computational challenge in accounting for uncertainties in signal parameters. In this article, we lay out a technique to meet this challenge using summed Fourier transform coefficients. Applying this technique to one all-sky search algorithm called TwoSpect, we confirm that the sensitivity of all-sky, semi-coherent searches can be improved by coherently combining the short data segments. For misaligned detectors, however, this improvement requires careful attention when marginalizing over unknown polarization parameters.

Our approach did not provide the other components of the virtual-casing magnetic field.   In this letter, we show that a more direct and more general approach is available for the computation of the virtual-casing magnetic field. The Kapur-Rokhlin quadrature rule accurately calculates the principal value integrals in the expression for all the components of the magnetic field on the plasma boundary, and the numerical error converges at a rate nearly as high as the indirect method we presented previously.",physics.plasm-ph,2024,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06366v4,One Policy to Run Them All: an End-to-end Learning Approach to Multi-Embodiment Locomotion,"Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques are achieving state-of-the-art results in robust legged locomotion. While there exists a wide variety of legged platforms such as quadruped, humanoids, and hexapods, the field is still missing a single learning framework that can control all these different embodiments easily and effectively and possibly transfer, zero or few-shot, to unseen robot embodiments. We introduce URMA, the Unified Robot Morphology Architecture, to close this gap. Our framework brings the end-to-end Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning approach to the realm of legged robots, enabling the learned policy to control any type of robot morphology. The key idea of our method is to allow the network to learn an abstract locomotion controller that can be seamlessly shared between embodiments thanks to our morphology-agnostic encoders and decoders. This flexible architecture can be seen as a potential first step in building a foundation model for legged robot locomotion. Our experiments show that URMA can learn a locomotion policy on multiple embodiments that can be easily transferred to unseen robot platforms in simulation and the real world.","cs.RO,cs.LG",2024,human

Instead, it is extremely broad, answering key science questions in nearly every branch of astronomy while also providing a dense and accurate visible-NIR reference frame needed for future astronomy facilities. For almost 2 billion common stars the combination of Gaia and a new all-sky NIR astrometry mission would provide much improved proper motions, answering key science questions -- from the solar system and stellar systems, including exoplanet systems, to compact galaxies, quasars, neutron stars, binaries and dark matter substructures. The addition of NIR will result in up to 8 billion newly measured stars in some of the most obscured parts of our Galaxy, and crucially reveal the very heart of the Galactic bulge region. In this white paper we argue that rather than improving on the accuracy, a greater overall science return can be achieved by going deeper than Gaia and by expanding the wavelength range to the NIR.","astro-ph.IM,astro-ph.GA",2019,human

HOPS scales to any number of environmental conditions by leveraging the Hyperdimensional Computing framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach is highly generalizable and consistently improves recall performance across all evaluated VPR methods and datasets by large margins.

Polarizer is an indispensable optical element for direct polarization generations. Except common linear and circular polarizations, however, arbitrary polarization generation heavily resorts to bulky optical components by cascading linear polarizers and waveplates. Here, we present a general strategy for designing all-in-one full Poincaré sphere polarizers based on perfect arbitrary polarization conversion dichroism, and realize it in a monolayer all-dielectric metasurface. It allows preferential transmission and conversion of one polarization state locating at an arbitrary position of the Poincaré sphere to its handedness-flipped state, while completely blocking its orthogonal state. In contrast to previous work with limited flexibility to only linear or circular polarizations, our method manifests perfect dichroism close to 100% in theory and exceeding 90% in experiments for arbitrary polarization states. Leveraging this tantalizing dichroism, our demonstration of monolithic full Poincaré sphere polarization generators directly from unpolarized light can enormously extend the scope of meta-optics and dramatically push the state-of-the-art nanophotonic devices.",physics.optics,2020,human

The proposed unsupervised method adopts a novel partial OT paradigm to learn a transport plan and node embeddings simultaneously. In a from-one-to-all manner, the entire learning procedure is decomposed into a series of easy-to-solve sub-procedures, each of which only handles the alignment of a single type of nodes.

Spin reorientation process rather than the traditional spin flop (SF) occurs, resulting in a novel phase in which Néel vectors preserve the mirror-reflection symmetry (termed as ``MRS phase""). The phase transitions between SF and MRS phases can be either the first- or second-order. After disturbed by external stimuli, magnons with different parities emerge. For in-plane dc fields, no couplings between magnons occur. When dc fields become oblique, coherent couplings between magnons with opposite parity emerge, leading to anticrossings in resonance frequencies. However, self-hybridization among magnons with the same parity never happens.

Alternatively, in the 'closed' operation, the switch geometrically separates single-photon and two-photon states. We demonstrate the concept using a three-site Stub unit cell and the diamond chain. The systems are modeled by Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonians, and the dynamics is solved by exact diagonalization with Lindblad master equation. We discuss realization of the switch using photonic lattices with nonlinearities, superconductive qubit arrays, and ultracold atoms.

The approach is experimentally realized by introducing a weak coupling between the polarization degree of freedom of light and the path degree of freedom in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the presence of a weak anisotropy effect. Real and imaginary weak value amplifications of different polarization anisotropy effects are manifested as characteristic changes in relevant Stokes vector elements at the exit port of the interferometer, which follow orthogonal trajectories in the Poincare sphere. The proof of concept experiment demonstrates that using this scheme, one can faithfully extract and quantify anisotropy parameter that is smaller than the typical sensitivity of measurement of a given Stokes parameter of a traditional polarimeter by a large weak value amplification factor.

Moreover, we integrate the acquired degradation-aware prompts into the time embedding of diffusion model to improve degradation perception. Meanwhile, we employ the latent caption prompt to guide the reverse sampling process using the cross-attention mechanism, thereby guiding the accurate image reconstruction. Furthermore, to accelerate the reverse sampling procedure of diffusion model and address the limitations of frequency perception, we introduce a wavelet-oriented noise estimating network (WNE-Net).

The strong nonclassicality of the states after storage becomes manifest as a negative region in the corresponding Wigner function shifted away from the origin in phase space. This negativity is otherwise, without the phase information of the memory system, unobtainable. While our scheme includes the possibility of optical storage, on-demand release and synchronization of arbitrary single-rail qubit states, it is not limited to such states.

Electrical readout via the anomalous Hall effect reveals a switching contrast of up to 90% for 500 nm-wide devices. In larger Hall crosses, the contrast decreases and switching becomes stochastic, consistent with spatially non-uniform optical absorption as confirmed by finite-element simulations. This behavior is hypothetically attributed to domain wall relaxation and thermally assisted (de)pinning processes within partially switched regions.

Let $MWT(C)$ be the weight of a minimum weight spanning tree of $K_{C}.$   We show that the all-pairs shortest path problem for a directed graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with nonnegative real weights and adjacency matrix $A_G$ can be solved by a combinatorial randomized algorithm in time $$\widetilde{O}(n^{2}\sqrt {n + \min\{MWT(A_G), MWT(A_G^t)\}})$$   As a corollary, we conclude that the transitive closure of a directed graph $G$ can be computed by a combinatorial randomized algorithm in the aforementioned time. $\widetilde{O}(n^{2}\sqrt {n + \min\{MWT(A_G), MWT(A_G^t)\}})$   We also conclude that the all-pairs shortest path problem for uniform disk graphs, with nonnegative real vertex weights, induced by point sets of bounded density within a unit square can be solved in time $\widetilde{O}(n^{2.75})$.",cs.DS,2011,human

Neglecting operator interference, I consider all Galilean invariant interaction operators that can arise from the exchange of a heavy particle of spin less than or equal to one when WIMPs have spin 0, 1/2 or 1. I compute position and shape of the expected resonances in the mass - capture rate plane and show that Iron is not the most important element in the capture process for many currently ignored interaction operators. I compare these predictions with the recent results of an Earth WIMP analysis of IceCube in the 86-string configuration and set limits on all isoscalar and isovector coupling constants of the effective theory of dark matter-nucleon interactions. For certain interaction operators and for a dark matter particle mass of about 50 GeV, I find that these limits are stronger than those I have previously derived in an analysis of the solar WIMP search performed at IceCube in the 79-string configuration.","astro-ph.CO,hep-ph",2016,human

We identify a specific operation which is a necessary property of all healthy human conscious individuals -- specifically the operation of self-certainty, or the capacity of healthy conscious humans to ""know"" with certainty that they are conscious. This operation is shown to be inconsistent with the properties possible in any meaningful definition of a physical system. This inconsistency is demonstrated by proving a ""no-go"" theorem for any physical system capable of human logical reasoning, if this reasoning is required to be both sound and consistent. The proof of this theorem is both general -- it applies to any function whereby evidence affects the state of some physical system -- and recursive, since any physical process subserving a function of this type is shown to imply another such function. Thus for at least one aspect of human consciousness, the mind-body problem is now conclusively resolved.",q-bio.NC,2017,human

Several studies have made attempts to calibrate the efficiency of different convective boundary mixing mechanisms, with sometimes seemingly conflicting results. Aims: We aim to demonstrate that stellar models regularly under-predict the masses of convective stellar cores. Methods: We gather convective core mass and fractional core hydrogen content inferences from numerous independent binary and asteroseismic studies, and compare them to stellar evolution models computed with the MESA stellar evolution code. Results: We demonstrate that core mass inferences from the literature are ubiquitously more massive than predicted by stellar evolution models without or with little convective boundary mixing. Conclusions: Independent of the form of internal mixing, stellar models require an efficient mixing mechanism that produces more massive cores throughout the main sequence to reproduce high-precision observations. This has implications for the post-main sequence evolution of all stars which have a well developed convective core on the main sequence.",astro-ph.SR,2021,human

The extension is based on the mapping rule between non-linear spectra of DE models with constant equation of state and those with time varying one originally introduced in ref. [40]. Using a series of N-body simulations we show that the spectral equivalence is accurate to sub-percent level across the same range of modes and redshift covered by the Coyote suite. Thus, the extended emulator provides a very efficient and accurate tool to predict non-linear power spectra for DE models with w_0 - w_a parametrization.

These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration.

Specifically, ClusIR comprises two key components: a Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) and a Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM). The proposed PCGRM disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation, enabling discriminative degradation perception and stable expert routing. Meanwhile, DAFMM leverages the cluster-guided priors to perform adaptive frequency decomposition and targeted modulation, collaboratively refining structural and textural representations for higher restoration fidelity. The cluster-guided synergy seamlessly bridges semantic cues with frequency-domain modulation, empowering ClusIR to attain remarkable restoration results across a wide range of degradations.

We propose a metasurface consisting of periodically arranged infinite-long cylinders made from multiple layers of SiO2 and WS2. The cylinder exhibits strong backward scattering due to the overlapping magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole resonances. Without non-local coupling in unit cells, the infinite-size metasurface manifests high reflection across all instances. However, parity-dependent reflectivity diverges with non-local coupling in supercells, exhibiting either increased logarithmic or decreased exponential behavior, with significant distinctions at small particle numbers. Interestingly, equal magnitude reflection and transmission reversals are achievable through alternation between adjacent odd and even particle numbers. The finite-size non-local metasurfaces behave similarly to the infinite-size counterparts, yet high reflection disappears at small particle numbers due to energy leakage. Essentially, high reflection arises from strong backward scattering and effective suppression of lateral multiple scatterings.

Magnetization precession is triggered by heating of the metallic layer with femtosecond laser pulses. The heating modifies the magneto-crystalline anisotropy of the YIG film and shifts the quasi-equilibrium orientation of magnetization, which results in precessional magnetization dynamics. The laser-induced magnetization precession corresponds to a uniform (Kittel) magnon mode, with the precession frequency determined by the magnetic anisotropy of the material as well as the external magnetic field, and the damping time set by a Gilbert damping parameter. The AO-FMR method thus enables measuring local magnetic properties, with spatial resolution given only by the laser spot size.","physics.optics,cond-mat.mtrl-sci",2021,human

Additionally, we investigate the impact of various fabrication errors on the imaging quality of the metalens, several of which are unique to such large area metasurfaces. We demonstrate direct astronomical imaging of the Sun, the Moon, and emission nebulae at visible wavelengths and validate the robustness of such metasurfaces under extreme environmental thermal swings for space applications.","physics.optics,astro-ph.IM,physics.app-ph,physics.space-ph",2023,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10020v1,An optical all-pass filter realized by using self-compensation of loss,"Filters are key devices in optical systems and are usually applied to signal suppression or selection based on their amplitude frequency responses. Different from amplitude filtering, an all-pass filter (APF) is a unique type of filter that exhibits a uniform amplitude and variable phase in the frequency response. Traditionally, an APF is designed to be ideal and lossless, which is impossible in practice. Here we demonstrate a method of realizing an APF even when transmission loss exists, and a possible structure for realizing the lossy APF is proposed. The method indicates that a lossy APF can be realized by introducing self-compensation of loss to the structure of an ideal single-stage APF, and an APF based on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) foundry is fabricated and demonstrated. The method of self-compensation of loss can also be used to realize APFs in the electrical domain. We anticipate that our work will inspire realizations of more APF-related devices that once seemed impossible in practice.","physics.optics,physics.app-ph",2019,human

The latter can lead to resistivity anomalies, the so-called Kondo effect, reshape extrinsically Hall effects or reduce the efficiency of magnetoresistance effects essential in spintronics. Here we demonstrate that atomic defects enable highly efficient all-electrical detection of spin-swirling textures, in particular magnetic skyrmions, which are promising bits candidates in future spintronics devices. Impurities amplify the bare transport signal and can alter significantly the spin-mixing magnetoresistance (XMR) depending on their chemical nature. Both effects are monitored in terms of the defect-enhanced XMR (DXMR) as shown for 3d and 4d transition metal defects implanted at the vicinity of skyrmions generated in PdFe bilayer deposited on Ir(111).

The first pulse of the sequence induces coherence directly from a mixed state, and the technique is used to measure the nuclear spin coherence of an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble of rare-earth ions (Pr$^{3+}$). In contrast to previous experiments it does not require any preparatory hole burning pulse sequences, which greatly shortens the total duration of the sequence. The effect of the different pulses is characterized by quantum state tomography and is compared with simulations.

We found 23 afterglow candidates, where about 4 detections are predicted. However, follow-up spectroscopy of several counterpart candidates strongly suggests a flare star origin of the RASS events in many cases. We conclude that the RASS data are consistent with comparable beaming angles in the X-ray (within a few hours of the burst) and gamma-ray bands.

Moreover, the strength of molecule-helium coupling and the effective radius of the solvation shell corotating along with the molecular rotor could be estimated qualitatively. This model not only provides the significant enlightenment for analyzing the rotational spectroscopy of molecules in the phononic environment, but also provides a new method to study the transfer of the phonon angular momentum in angulon frame.","cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph",2023,human

Here we assess the consequences of this assumption by removing it and exploring the effect of giant branch mass loss on the stability of two-planet systems with small to moderate non-Kozai (<40 degrees) relative inclinations. We run nearly 10^4 simulations over 14 Gyr for F-star, A-star and B-star planet hosts, incorporating main sequence stellar masses of 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 5.0 solar masses, and initial planetary semimajor axis ratios that straddle their three-dimensional Hill stability limits. We find that the near-coplanar assumption can approximate well the stability frequencies and critical separations found for higher inclinations, except around strong mean-motion commensurabilities. Late instabilities -- after the star has become a white dwarf -- occur throughout the explored mutual inclination range. Consequently, non-Kozai mutual inclination should not be used as a predictive orbital proxy for determining which white dwarf multi-planet systems discovered by Gaia should represent high-priority follow-up targets for the detection of metal pollution and planetary debris discs.","astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.SR",2018,human

Our rigorous proof further fills some apparent gaps in prior derivations of GEPs from parameter optimization problems. We further detail a measurement protocol for formulating the classical parameter optimization that does not require us to implement any (time evolution with a) problem-specific objective Hamiltonian or a quantum feasibility oracle.

To tackle this, we propose LoRA-IR, a flexible framework that dynamically leverages compact low-rank experts to facilitate efficient all-in-one image restoration. Specifically, LoRA-IR consists of two training stages: degradation-guided pre-training and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, we enhance the pre-trained CLIP model by introducing a simple mechanism that scales it to higher resolutions, allowing us to extract robust degradation representations that adaptively guide the IR network.

As a concrete example, we study the cusp in the hemisphere mass distribution of $e^+e^-\to$ hadrons events groomed with soft drop. We identify the leading emissions that contribute in the region about the cusp and formulate an all-orders factorization theorem that describes how the cusp is resolved through arbitrary strongly-ordered soft and collinear emissions. The factorization theorem exhibits numerous novel features such as contributions from collinear modes that can cross hemisphere boundaries as well as requiring explicit subtraction of the limit in which resolved emissions become collinear to the hard core. We present resummation of the cusp region through next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy and describe how it can be matched with established factorization theorems that describe other groomed phase space regions.","hep-ph,hep-ex",2021,human

While coherent light is conventionally employed in optical neural networks, our study proposes harnessing spatially incoherent light in all-optical Fourier neural networks. Contrary to numerical predictions of declining target recognition accuracy with increased incoherence, our experimental results demonstrate a surprising outcome: improved accuracy with incoherent light. We attribute this unexpected enhancement to spatially incoherent light's ability to alleviate experimental errors like diffraction rings, laser speckle, and edge effects. Our controlled experiments introduced spatial incoherence by passing monochromatic light through a spatial light modulator featuring a dynamically changing random phase array. These findings underscore partially coherent light's potential to optimize optical neural networks, delivering dependable and efficient solutions for applications demanding consistent accuracy and robustness across diverse conditions.",physics.optics,2024,human

Yet academic researchers still lack a fully open, end-to-end MoE platform for investigating scaling, routing, and expert behavior. We release FLAME-MoE, a completely open-source research suite composed of seven decoder-only models, ranging from 38M to 1.7B active parameters, whose architecture--64 experts with top-8 gating and 2 shared experts--closely reflects modern production LLMs. All training data pipelines, scripts, logs, and checkpoints are publicly available to enable reproducible experimentation. Across six evaluation tasks, FLAME-MoE improves average accuracy by up to 3.4 points over dense baselines trained with identical FLOPs. Leveraging full training trace transparency, we present initial analyses showing that (i) experts increasingly specialize on distinct token subsets, (ii) co-activation matrices remain sparse, reflecting diverse expert usage, and (iii) routing behavior stabilizes early in training.

These systems were selected to have at least two distinguishable galaxies separated by less than three average galactic diameters, and thus we have excluded very widely separated systems and very advanced mergers. The new complete survey has the same properties as the prototype survey of Surace et al. 1993. We find no increased tendency for infrared-bright galaxies to be associated with other infrared bright galaxies among the widely separated pairs studied here.

The most promising approaches have been predominantly focused on improving model uncertainty (e.g. deep ensembles and Bayesian neural networks) and post-processing techniques for OOD detection (e.g. ODIN and Mahalanobis distance). However, there has been relatively little investigation into how the parametrization of the probabilities in discriminative classifiers affects the uncertainty estimates, and the dominant method, softmax cross-entropy, results in misleadingly high confidences on OOD data and under covariate shift. We investigate alternative ways of formulating probabilities using (1) a one-vs-all formulation to capture the notion of ""none of the above"", and (2) a distance-based logit representation to encode uncertainty as a function of distance to the training manifold. We show that one-vs-all formulations can improve calibration on image classification tasks, while matching the predictive performance of softmax without incurring any additional training or test-time complexity.","cs.LG,stat.ML",2020,human

Inspired by the recent emergence of neural network diffusion, we present Tina, a text-conditioned neural network diffusion for train-once-for-all personalization. Tina leverages a diffusion transformer model conditioned on task descriptions embedded using a CLIP model. Despite the astronomical number of potential personalized tasks (e.g., $1.73\times10^{13}$), by our design, Tina demonstrates remarkable in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization even trained on small datasets ($\sim 1000$).

The accelerator is operated in the self-injection regime, producing quasi-monoenergetic electron beams of around 150 MeV peak energy. Scattering with the intense femtosecond laser pulse leads to the emission of a collimated high energy photon beam. Using continuum-attenuation filters we measure significant signal content beyond 100 keV and with simulations we estimate a peak photon energy of around 500 keV. The source divergence is about 13 mrad and the pointing stability is 7 mrad. We demonstrate that the photon yield from the source is sufficiently high to illuminate a centimeter-size sample placed 90 centimeters behind the source, thus obtaining radiographs in a single shot.","physics.plasm-ph,physics.acc-ph",2015,human

They conjectured a set of apparently obvious monotonicity properties of the optimal allocation function $K(x,t)$. Although some of these conjectures, and versions thereof, have been proved or disproved by other authors since then, the remaining central question, that $K(x,t)$ is nondecreasing in~$x$, remains unsettled. After reviewing the problem and summarizing the state of these conjectures, in the setting where $x$ is continuous we prove the existence of a ``spend-it-all'' region in which $K(x,t)=x$ and find its boundary, inside of which the long-standing, unproven conjecture of monotonicity of~$K(\cdot,t)$ holds.

The DAC can be synthesized entirely in an FPGA and does not require the use of external components. Furthermore, and to extend its range of applications, a discussion regarding the proposed DAC's problems and possible solutions is presented. Experimental demonstration of a 4-bit and a 5-bit DAC corroborate the theoretical analysis developed in this work. This work also suggests a scheme which includes few external resistors to improve the linearity (DNL$\leq$0.25LSB and an INL$\leq$0.5LSB), and the power consumption (5X improvement over the standalone configuration).","eess.SP,eess.SY",2020,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09677v3,A Generic Trajectory Planning Method for Constrained All-Wheel-Steering Robots,"This paper presents a generic trajectory planning method for wheeled robots with fixed steering axes while the steering angle of each wheel is constrained. In the existing literatures, All-Wheel-Steering (AWS) robots, incorporating modes such as rotation-free translation maneuvers, in-situ rotational maneuvers, and proportional steering, exhibit inefficient performance due to time-consuming mode switches. This inefficiency arises from wheel rotation constraints and inter-wheel cooperation requirements. The direct application of a holonomic moving strategy can lead to significant slip angles or even structural failure. Additionally, the limited steering range of AWS wheeled robots exacerbates non-linearity characteristics, thereby complicating control processes. To address these challenges, we developed a novel planning method termed Constrained AWS (C-AWS), which integrates second-order discrete search with predictive control techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method adeptly generates feasible and smooth trajectories for C-AWS while adhering to steering angle constraints.",cs.RO,2024,human

This second-order optimization scheme has been constructed to provide benchmark all-electron results with very tight convergence of the particle number constraint, associated chemical potential and electron density. It is demonstrated that, by preserving the saddle-point nature of the optimization and simultaneously optimizing the density and chemical potential, an order of magnitude reduction in the number of iterations required for convergence is obtained. The approach is compared and contrasted with a new implementation of the nested optimization scheme put forward by Chan, Cohen and Handy. Our implementation allows for semi-local kinetic-energy (and exchange-correlation) functionals to be handled self-consistently in all-electron calculations. The all-electron Gaussian-basis setting for these calculations will enable direct comparison with a wide range of standard high-accuracy quantum-chemical methods as well as with Kohn-Sham density-functional theory.

For a given allocation rule, we identify a class of optimal transfer candidates, named the win-lose dependent transfers, with the following property: each type of bidder's transfer conditional on winning or losing is independent of the competitor's type report. Our result reduces the infinite-dimensional optimal transfer problem to a two-dimensional optimization problem. By solving the reduced problem, we find that: (i) among efficient mechanisms with no premiums for losers, the first-price auction is optimal; and, (ii) among efficient winner-favored mechanisms where each bidder pays smaller amounts when she wins than loses: the all-pay auction is optimal.

The ability of a static electric field -applied by mean of a lateral gate electrode- to suppress the critical current $I_s$ in a proximity-induced superconductor is proven for both positive and negative gate voltage values. $I_s$ suppression reached typically about one third of its initial value, saturating at high gate voltages. The transconductance of our SNS-FETs obtains values as high as 100 nA/V at 100 mK. On the fundamental physics side, our results suggest that the mechanism at the basis of the observed phenomenon is quite general and does not rely on the existence of a true pairing potential, but rather the presence of superconducting correlations is enough for the effect to occur.

Using semi-classical numerical simulations, we find that in a temporally asymmetrical laser field, the spin rotation of a particle can be determined from the flexibly controllable phase retardation between its spin precession and momentum oscillation. An initial polarization of a proton beam can be rotated to any desired orientation (e.g., from the common transverse to the more useful longitudinal polarization) with extraordinary precision (better than 1\%) in tens of femtoseconds using a feasible frequency-chirped laser pulse. Moreover, the beam qualities, in terms of energy and angular divergence, can be significantly improved in the rotation process.

We will introduce all-at-once multigrid solvers for optimal control problems which show robust convergence in the grid size and in the regularization parameter. We will refer to recent publications that guarantee such a convergence behavior. These publications do not pay much attention to the construction of the smoother and suggest to use a normal equation smoother. We will see that using a Gauss Seidel like variant of this smoother, the overall multigrid solver is speeded up by a factor of about two with no additional work. The author will give a proof which indicates that also the Gauss Seidel like variant of the smoother is covered by the convergence theory. Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed method are competitive with Vanka type methods.",math.NA,2015,human

As a practical example, we present a treatment of the orbital-dependent exact-exchange (EXX) energy and potential. A formulation in terms of a mixed product basis, which is constructed from products of LAPW basis functions, enables a solution of the optimized-effective-potential (OEP) equation with standard numerical algebraic tools and without shape approximations for the resulting potential. We find that the mixed product and LAPW basis sets must be properly balanced to obtain smooth and converged EXX potentials without spurious oscillations. The construction and convergence of the exchange potential is analyzed in detail for diamond. Our all-electron results for C, Si, SiC, Ge, GaAs semiconductors as well as Ne and Ar noble-gas solids are in very favorable agreement with plane-wave pseudopotential calculations. This confirms the adequacy of the pseudopotential approximation in the context of the EXX-OEP formalism and clarifies a previous contradiction between FLAPW and pseudopotential results.",cond-mat.mtrl-sci,2011,human

Recently, the analysis of this algorithm was refined and it was shown to have an expected optimization time (w.r.t. the number of fitness evaluations) of $Θ(n^{3.25}(\log n)^{0.25})$.   In contrast to this simple algorithm, evolutionary algorithms used in practice usually employ refined recombination strategies in order to avoid the creation of infeasible offspring. We study extensions of the basic algorithm by two such concepts which are central in recombination, namely \emph{repair mechanisms} and \emph{parent selection}. We show that repairing infeasible offspring leads to an improved expected optimization time of $\mathord{O}(n^{3.2}(\log n)^{0.2})$. As a second part of our study we prove that choosing parents that guarantee feasible offspring results in an even better optimization time of $\mathord{O}(n^{3}\log n)$.   Both results show that already simple adjustments of the recombination operator can asymptotically improve the runtime of evolutionary algorithms.",cs.NE,2012,human

Here we show that the shortest path distances can be found by a simple matrix inversion: If the edges are given by the adjacency matrix $A_{ij}$ then with a suitably small value of $γ$ the shortest path distances are   $$ D_{ij} = \operatorname{ceil} \left( \log_γ {\left[ {\left({\mathbf{I}}-γ{\mathbf{A}}\right)^{-1}} \right]}_{ij} \right)$$   We derive several graph-theoretic bounds on the value of $γ$, and explore its useful range with numerics on different graph types. Even when the distance function is not globally accurate across the entire graph, it still works locally to instruct pursuit of the shortest path. In this mode, it also extends to weighted graphs with positive edge weights. For a wide range of dense graphs this distance function is computationally faster than the best available alternative. Finally we show that this method leads naturally to a neural network solution of the all-pairs-shortest-path problem.","cs.DS,q-bio.NC",2023,human

This richness, which flows from the complex internal structure of molecules, makes the creation of ultracold molecular gases using traditional methods (laser plus evaporative cooling) a challenge, in particular due to the spontaneous decay of molecules into dark states. We propose a way to circumvent this key bottleneck using an all-optical method for decelerating molecules using stimulated absorption and emission with a single ultrafast laser. We further describe single-photon cooling of the decelerating molecules that exploits their high dark state pumping rates, turning the principal obstacle to molecular laser cooling into an advantage. Cooling and deceleration may be applied simultaneously and continuously to load molecules into a trap.

Different nonlinear effects inherent to such microcavities are studied when used for realizing an all-optical autonomous computing substrate, here based on the reservoir computing concept. We provide an in-depth analysis of the impact of basic microcavity parameters on computational metrics of the system, namely, the dimensionality and the consistency. Importantly, we find that differences between frequencies and bandwidths of supermodes formed by the direct coupling is the determining factor of the reservoir's dimensionality and its scalability. The network's dimensionality can be improved with frequency-shifting nonlinear effects such as the Kerr effect, while two-photon absorption has an opposite effect.

The derived analytical HDRM model supports a hierarchical control structure that seamlessly maps high-level force and velocity objectives to real-time actuator commands, accompanied by a Lyapunov-based stability proof. In multi-domain simulations of both cubic and a custom planar triangular trajectory, the proposed adaptive modular controller achieves sub-centimeter Cartesian tracking accuracy. Experimental validation of the same 1-DoF platform under realistic load emulation confirms the efficacy of the proposed control strategy.

The TMR originates from the symmetry-driven spin filtering provided by the insulating BaTiO3 barrier to the electrons injected from SrRuO3. In contrast the TER is possible only when a thin SrTiO3 layer is intercalated at one of the SrRuO3/BaTiO3 interfaces. As the complex band-structure of SrTiO3 has the same symmetry than that of BaTiO3, the inclusion of such an intercalated layer does not negatively alter the TMR and in fact increases it. Crucially, the magnitude of the TER also scales with the thickness of the SrTiO3 layer. The SrTiO3 thickness becomes then a single control parameter for both the TMR and the TER effect. This protocol offers a practical way to the fabrication of four-state memory cells.",cond-mat.mtrl-sci,2012,human

However, foundational theoretical questions about this algorithm's privacy loss remain open -- even in the seemingly simple setting of smooth convex losses over a bounded domain. Our main result resolves these questions: for a large range of parameters, we characterize the differential privacy up to a constant factor. This result reveals that all previous analyses for this setting have the wrong qualitative behavior. Specifically, while previous privacy analyses increase ad infinitum in the number of iterations, we show that after a small burn-in period, running SGD longer leaks no further privacy.   Our analysis departs from previous approaches based on fast mixing, instead using techniques based on optimal transport (namely, Privacy Amplification by Iteration) and the Sampled Gaussian Mechanism (namely, Privacy Amplification by Sampling).

In the experiment, one part of the laser beam was used to drive a few-fs bunch of quasi-monoenergetic electrons from a Laser-Wakefield Accelerator (LWFA), while the remainder was scattered off the bunch in a near-counter-propagating geometry. When the electron energy was tuned from 10-50 MeV, narrow-bandwidth X-ray spectra peaking at 5-35keV were directly measured, limited in photon energy by the sensitivity curve of our X-ray detector. Due to the ultrashort LWFA electron bunches, these beams exhibit few-fs pulse duration.","physics.plasm-ph,physics.acc-ph",2014,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23592v1,Coherent all-optical tuning of large-area phase-gradient metasurface,"Tunable active metasurfaces have become a major research focus in recent years. Among tuning mechanisms, all-optical coherent control stands out because it requires no material or geometric change, enabling ultrafast, low-energy, interference-based modulation of amplitude, phase, and polarization in ultrathin devices. However, when applied to phase-gradient metasurfaces, coherent control has been limited to small apertures effectively confined to a single Fresnel zone, leading to large divergence and degraded beam quality. Here we propose and numerically validate a scalable method that enables large-area coherent control. The key idea is to use coherent illumination to tune the phase gradient within each Fresnel zone while a direct search algorithm optimizes zone-by-zone parameters to meet system-level targets. Using this principle, we demonstrate continuous tuning of a large-area metasurface for continuous beam-steering without per-meta-atom phase actuation. The same framework applies broadly to continuously tunable phase-gradient optics, including varifocal metalenses, parfocal zoom metalenses, tunable axicons, and related dynamic focusing elements.",physics.optics,2025,human

Exclusion limits are set in simplified supersymmetry models with the top squark decaying to jets and an undetected neutralino, either via a top quark or through a bottom quark and chargino. Models with the top squark decaying via a top quark are excluded for top squark masses up to 755 GeV in the case of neutralino masses below 200 GeV. For decays via a chargino, top squark masses up to 620 GeV are excluded, depending on the masses of the chargino and neutralino.",hep-ex,2016,human

By establishing general conditions for adiabatic evolution between quantum states in parameter space, we derive the essential pulse area and phase conditions necessary for quantum state transfer in a resonant single-$Λ$ three-level system. We extend this approach to a double-$Λ$ four-level system by incorporating a neighboring intermediate state, which leads to a single-photon detuned $Λ$ three-level system. Through numerical simulations of the ultracold $^{87}$Rb atomic system, we demonstrate that high-fidelity and robust control of quantum state transfer can be achieved in the single-$Λ$ three-level system using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) and the pulsed jump protocol. Furthermore, we show that the destructive quantum interference effects between resonant and detuned Raman pathways in the double-$Λ$ four-level system can be mitigated by optimizing the pulse area and two-photon detuning parameters within the pulsed jump protocol.

Cryogenic cooling of this mirror is also challenging, and thus thermal noise becomes a general problem. Here, we theoretically investigate an all-reflective coupling scheme of two optical cavities based on a 3-port diffraction grating.

The results exhibit values of $ξ{\approx}4.6$ and $σ{\approx}2.25{\times}10^5 Ω^{-1} m^{-1}$ for WTe$_2$. Moreover, we obtain the significantly reduced switching current density of $3.90{\times}10^6 A/cm^2$ at 150 K, which is an order of magnitude smaller than those of conventional heavy-metal/ ferromagnet thin films.

In conventional C-RAN, the fronthaul links used to exchange the signal between Base Band Units (BBUs) and Remote Antenna Units (RAUs) are based on digital baseband (BB) signals over optical fibers due to the huge bandwidth required. In this paper we evaluate the transport capability of copper-based all-analog fronthaul architecture called Radio over Copper (RoC) that leverages on the pre-existing LAN cables that are already deployed in buildings and enterprises. In particular, the main contribution of the paper is to evaluate the number of independent BB signals for multiple antennas system that can be transported over multi-pair Cat-5/6/7 cables under a predefined fronthauling transparency condition in terms of maximum BB signal degradation.

Specifically, the pair Coupled Cluster Doubles (pCCD) ansatz allows us to accurately describe bond dissociation processes and heavy-element containing compounds with multiple quasi-degenerate single-particle states. Here, we extend the pCCD method to model excited states using the equation of motion (EOM) formalism. As the cluster operator of pCCD is restricted to electron-pair excitations, EOM-pCCD allows us to target excited electron-pair states only. To model singly excited states within EOM-pCCD, we modify the configuration interaction ansatz of EOM-pCCD to contain also single excitations. Our proposed model represents a simple and cost-effective alternative to conventional EOM-CC methods to study singly excited electronic states. The performance of the excited state models is assessed against the lowest-lying excited states of the uranyl cation and the two lowest-lying excited states of all-trans polyenes.

We develop a model of these two coexisting effects, allowing us to use polarization microscopy to disentangle them through their spatial distributions, temporal evolutions and spectral dependencies. We experimentally observe strain-induced patterns that are an order of magnitude larger than that which can be accounted for by laser-induced heating alone, suggesting that non-thermal effects must also play a role.

The scheme relies on optical injection of the data signal into the MWL, where strong mode coupling enables transfer of the modulation to other longitudinal modes. A monolithically integrated feedback cavity provides agile switching between three longitudinal modes or even broadcasting across the three channels by adjusting the feedback phase. We evaluate the signal quality of the converted data through BER measurements for various symbol rates, showing both transparent conversion and, at low injection powers, even net signal gain.

Analogous to free-space spatial light modulators, we demonstrate all-optical wavefront shaping in integrated silicon-on-insulator photonic devices by modifying the spatial refractive index profile of the device employing ultraviolet pulsed laser excitation. Applying appropriate excitation patterns grants us full control over the optical transfer function of telecommunication-wavelength light travelling through the device, thus allowing us to redefine its functionalities. As a proof-of-concept, we experimentally demonstrate routing of light between the ports of a multimode interference power splitter with more than 97% total efficiency and negligible losses. Wavefront shaping in integrated photonic circuits provides a conceptually new approach toward achieving highly adaptable and field-programmable photonic circuits with applications in optical testing and data communication.","physics.optics,cond-mat.mes-hall,nlin.PS",2016,human

The study of strong coupling has been motivated by applications such as lasing and the modification of chemical processes. Here we show that strong coupling can be used to create phase singularities. Many nanophotonic structures have been designed to generate phase singularities for use in sensing and optoelectronics. We utilise the concept of cavity-free strong coupling, where electromagnetic modes sustained by a material are strong enough to strongly couple to the material's own molecular resonance, to create phase singularities in a simple thin film of organic molecules. We show that the use of photochromic molecules allows for all-optical control of phase singularities. Our results suggest a new application for strong light-matter coupling and a new, simplified, more versatile pathway to singular phase optics.","cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.app-ph,physics.optics",2021,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10843v1,Bridging Unsupervised and Supervised Depth from Focus via All-in-Focus Supervision,"Depth estimation is a long-lasting yet important task in computer vision. Most of the previous works try to estimate depth from input images and assume images are all-in-focus (AiF), which is less common in real-world applications. On the other hand, a few works take defocus blur into account and consider it as another cue for depth estimation. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate not only a depth map but an AiF image from a set of images with different focus positions (known as a focal stack). We design a shared architecture to exploit the relationship between depth and AiF estimation. As a result, the proposed method can be trained either supervisedly with ground truth depth, or \emph{unsupervisedly} with AiF images as supervisory signals. We show in various experiments that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, and also has higher efficiency in inference time.",cs.CV,2021,human

In recent years, several deterministic protocols have been proposed to generate RGS. However, they can only create bare RGS and a rate-distance analysis for the deterministic approach is currently missing. We present a deterministic generation scheme of encoded RGS and show that after optimization, the repeater using our scheme performs at least 4.9 times better than the traditional probabilistic generation scheme in terms of secret key rate, with a significant reduction in the total number photons by 2 orders of magnitude. The duration of our generation protocol is only half of the existing deterministic schemes.

A recent measurement performed using H.E.S.S. extends the all-electron (electron+positron) spectrum up to 20TeV, probing very local sources and transport due to the $\sim$10~kyr cooling time of these particles. An additional key local measurement was the recent estimation of the ISM diffusion coefficient around Geminga performed using HAWC. The inferred diffusion coefficient is much lower than typically assumed values. It has been argued that if this diffusion coefficient is representative of the local ISM, pulsars would not be able to account for the all-electron spectrum measured at the Earth. Here we show that a low diffusion coefficient in the local ISM is compatible with a pulsar wind nebula origin of the highest energy electrons, if a so far undiscovered pulsar with spin-down power $\sim 10^{33-34}$ erg/s exists within 30 to 80~pc of the Earth.

Nearly all of these methods assume every unlabeled instance encountered will belong to a handful of known classes for which one has examples. This can be problematic for real-world use cases where one routinely finds 'none-of-the-above' examples. In this paper we describe this challenge of identifying what we term 'out-of-support' (OOS) examples. We describe how this problem is subtly different from out-of-distribution detection and describe a new method of identifying OOS examples within the Prototypical Networks framework using a fixed point which we call the generic representation. We show that our method outperforms other existing approaches in the literature as well as other approaches that we propose in this paper. Finally, we investigate how the use of such a generic point affects the geometry of a model's feature space.","cs.LG,cs.AI,cs.CV,math.MG",2021,human

In this paper, we classify all quivers with subadditive labelings. We conjecture them to exhibit a certain form of integrability, namely, as the $T$-system dynamics proceeds, the values at each vertex satisfy a linear recurrence. Conversely, we show that every quiver integrable in this sense is necessarily one of the $19$ items in our classification. For the quivers of type $\hat A \otimes A$ we express the coefficients of the recurrences in terms of the partition functions for domino tilings of a cylinder, called \emph{Goncharov-Kenyon Hamiltonians}. We also consider tropical $T$-systems of type $\hat A \otimes A$ and explain how affine slices exhibit solitonic behavior, i.e. soliton resolution and speed conservation.

The numerical results show that the integrated graphene can substantially reduce the Fano resonance due to the coupling effect between the intrinsic absorption of graphene with enhanced electric field in the localized hotspot. With the manipulation of the surface conductivity via varying Fermi level and the layer number of graphene, the Fano resonance strength obtains a significant modulation and is even switched off.

We show that the flow exhibits phase transitions which involve cross-over from regimes characterized by 2-shocks (pushing piston) to 2-rarefaction waves (retracting piston), with the appearance of cavitating states at critical amplitudes of the jump. Importantly, the appearance of vacuum points into the 2-shock marks the transition to a regime which is unique to the photon fluid.

At intermediate coupling, both methods were found to fail as they do not reproduce Diagrammatic Quantum Monte Carlo results. To resolve this, we modify the memory function formalism with respect to the Feynman-Hellwarth-Iddings-Platzman (FHIP) approach, in order to take into account a non-quadratic interaction in a model system for the polaron. The strong-coupling expansion is extended beyond the adiabatic approximation, by including into the treatment non-adiabatic transitions between excited polaron states.

The corresponding infrared finiteness of thermal fermionic QED has already been established. Here, we study the IR behaviour at finite temperatures, of a theory of dark matter interacting with charged scalars and fermions, which potentially contains both both linear and sub-leading logarithmic divergences. We prove that the theory is IR-finite to all orders with the divergences cancelling when both absorption and emission of photons from and into the heat bath are taken into account. While 4-point interaction terms are known to be IR finite, their inclusion leads to a neat exponentiation.

The platform consists of a two-dimensional Si/GeSn core/shell nanowire array on a silicon wafer. By tuning the light polarization, we show that the metasurface reflectance can be efficiently engineered due to Fano resonances emerging from the electric and magnetic dipoles competition. The interference of optically induced dipoles in high-index nanowire arrays offers additional degrees of freedom to tailor the directional scattering and the flow of light while enabling sharp polarization-modulated resonances.

For the preconditioned HLL scheme, the global cut-off problem is attributable to the denominator of the coefficients, whereas the particular pressure gradient sensor problem results from the loss of the capability to suppress the checkerboard pressure-velocity decoupling. A new all-speed HLL scheme, which can overcome these problems by only multiplying the momentum-derivative term in the momentum equation by a function related to the local Mach number, is proposed. More importantly, the present study shows the generality of the three rules, which can be powerful tools for analyzing and proposing schemes.

However, the open circuit voltage of typical tandem structures is generally smaller than the sum of the individual voltages in the single-junction form; a quantity we call the voltage gap. Subcell optimization can only begin once nonradiative losses associated with each absorber layer can be properly identified. To address this, we used absolute electroluminescence hyperspectral imaging to construct external radiative efficiency maps of each subcell within the tandem stack and compare these measurements with single junction devices. These measurements were then combined with additional electro-optical characterization and modeling to construct subcell current vs voltage curves. We find that the narrow band gap subcell contributes the most towards the voltage gap and therefore fabrication and processing efforts should focus on reducing nonradiative recombination losses within the narrow band gap absorber.","physics.optics,physics.app-ph",2025,human

Here we report ultrafast temperature sensing using all-optical thermometry exploiting synthetic nanodiamonds with silicon-vacancy (SiV) centres embedded at a high concentration. Using multi-parametric analysis of photoluminescence (PL) of these centres, we have achieved an intrinsic noise floor of about 10 mK Hz$^{-1/2}$, which is a thousand-fold increase in the readout speed in comparison to the current record values demonstrated with all-optical methods of comparable spatial-resolution and precision. Our thermometers are smaller than 250-nm across but can detect a 0.4$^\circ$C change of temperature in a measurement taking only 0.001 second.

With comprehensive simulations, we find that our Bayesian method with Poisson likelihood is generally more applicable for various bursts than $χ^{2}$ method, especially for weak bursts. We further proposed a location-spectrum iteration approach based on the Bayesian inference, which could alleviate the problems caused by the spectral difference between the burst and location templates. Our method is very suitable for scenarios with limited computation resources or time-sensitive applications, such as in-flight localization software, and low-latency localization for rapid follow-up observations.","astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.IM",2022,human

The rotational symmetry allows a circularly polarized pump to be converted into a circularly polarized nonlinear signal. Meanwhile, our bilayered metasurface can be engineered to respond solely to one selected circular polarization. Consequently, integrating resonant chiral response and rotational symmetry endows a unique category of metasurfaces to upconvert any linear or unpolarized pump into a circularly polarized nonlinear signal. Our results reveal that when such a metasurface is subjected to a linearly polarized pump, the intensity ratio of the resultant circularly polarized signals varies with the order of the nonlinear process. Counterintuitively, this ratio scales as the fourth power of the local field enhancement in the second harmonic process and the second power in the third harmonic process.

The considerably sharper Chandra view covers a fraction of RASS sources, whose $σ_{pos}$ could be improved by utilizing the sub-arcsec positional accuracy of Chandra observations. We cross-match X-ray objects between the BSC and \emph{Chandra} sources extracted from the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) archival observations. A combined counterparts list (BSCxACIS) with \emph{Chandra} spatial positions weighted by the X-ray flux of multi-counterparts is employed to evaluate and improve the former identifications of BSC with the other surveys.

It stems from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and enables the direct construction of overlapping local parametrizations using Schur parameters and interpolation points. The second approach proceeds in terms of state-space realizations. In the scalar case, a balanced canonical form exists that can also be parametrized by Schur parameters. This canonical form can be constructed recursively, using unitary matrix operations.

The stability of the cages was evaluated in terms of the activation barriers and the activation Gibbs energies of their thermal-induced breaking. We found that binding energies, bond lengths, and quantum-mechanical descriptors failed to predict the stability of the cages. However, we derived a simple topological rule that adjacent hexagons on the cage surface resulted in its instability. For this reason, the number of stable nitrogen cages is significantly restricted in comparison with their carbon counterparts. As a rule, smaller clusters are more stable, whereas earlier proposed rather large cages collapse at room temperature. The most stable all-nitrogen cages are N$_{4}$ and N$_{6}$ clusters, which can form the van-der-Waals crystals with the densities of 1.23 and 1.36 g/cm$^{3}$, respectively. Examination of their band structures and densities of electronic states shows that they are both insulators.

In our configuration, a strong, non-information-carrying pump is mixed with a weak control pump and an input signal in a silicon-on-insulator waveguide. Through the optical nonlinearity of this highly-confining waveguide, the weak pump controls the wavelength conversion process from the signal to an idler, leading to a controlled depletion of the signal. The strong pump, on the other hand, plays the role of a constant bias. In this work, we show experimentally that it is possible to implement this low-power switching technique as a first step towards universal optical logic gates, and test the performance with random binary data.

It is found that low coercivity enables thermally activated domain wall motion, limiting in turn the repeatability of the switching.

Here, we successfully generate sub-MeV vortex $γ$ photons via all-optical inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons colliding with a sub-relativistic Laguerre-Gaussian laser. In principle, directly measuring the OAM of $γ$ photons is challenging due to their incoherence and extremely short wavelength. Therein, we put forward a novel method to determine the OAM properties by revealing the quantum opening angle of vortex $γ$ photons, since vortex particles exhibit not only a spiral phase but also transverse momentum according to the quantum electrodynamics theory. Thus,$γ$ photons carrying OAM anifest a much larger angular distribution than those without OAM, which has been clearly observed in our experiments. This angular expansion is considered as an overall effect lying beyond classical theory.

However, most existing approaches typically lack explicit frequency modeling and rely on fixed or heuristic optimization schedules, which limit the generalization across heterogeneous degradation. To address these limitations, we propose EvoIR, an AiOIR-specific framework that introduces evolutionary frequency modulation for dynamic and adaptive image restoration. Specifically, EvoIR employs the Frequency-Modulated Module (FMM) that decomposes features into high- and low-frequency branches in an explicit manner and adaptively modulates them to enhance both structural fidelity and fine-grained details. Central to EvoIR, an Evolutionary Optimization Strategy (EOS) iteratively adjusts frequency-aware objectives through a population-based evolutionary process, dynamically balancing structural accuracy and perceptual fidelity. Its evolutionary guidance further mitigates gradient conflicts across degradation and accelerates convergence. By synergizing FMM and EOS, EvoIR yields greater improvements than using either component alone, underscoring their complementary roles. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that EvoIR outperforms state-of-the-art AiOIR methods.",cs.CV,2025,human

The coherent coupling of those two distinct resonances manifests a strong optical force, which is fundamentally different from the commonly studied form of radiation forces, the gradient forces, or photo-thermal induced deformation. It results in a giant third-order susceptibility $χ^{(3)}$ of $10^{-13}$ $m^2$/$V^2$, which is more than six orders of magnitude larger than that found in natural materials. The all-optical modulation at the frequency well above 1 GHz has thus been demonstrated experimentally.",physics.optics,2015,human

A double-ring passive subring resonator (DR-PSR) composed of two single-coupler fiber rings and a length of unpumped EDF-based saturable absorber filter is designed and employed in the EDFL to serve as the efficient SLM selecting element to guarantee SLM lasing with excellent output performance. The all-PM structure enables the proposed EDFL to present strong ability to resist the environment disturbance. At the pump power of 100 mW, we obtain an SLM EDFL with an ultra-high OSNR of 83 dB and an ultra-narrow linewidth of 459 Hz. For the SLM operation, the all-PM EDFL processes outstanding stability performance of both the wavelength lasing and the output power.

In particular, the survey holds great promise to investigate the tension between CMB and low-redshift measurements. The current bottleneck preventing the full exploitation of the survey data is the systematics associated with the relation between survey observable and halo mass. Numerous recent studies have shown that gas mass and core-excised X-ray luminosity exhibit very low scatter at fixed mass. We propose a new method to reconstruct these quantities from low photon count data and validate the method using extensive eROSITA-like simulations. We find that even near the detection threshold of ~50 counts the core-excised luminosity and the gas mass can be recovered with 20-30% precision, which is substantially less than the scatter of the full integrated X-ray luminosity at fixed mass. When combined with an accurate calibration of the absolute mass scale (e.g. through weak gravitational lensing), our technique reduces the systematics on cosmological parameters induced by the mass calibration.","astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.HE,astro-ph.IM",2020,human

We take as reference the performance of the soon-to-be-launched eROSITA satellite. The main astrophysical background sources against sterile neutrino decays are active galactic nuclei, galaxies powered by X-ray binaries, and clusters of galaxies. While sterile neutrino decays are always subdominant in the auto-correlation power spectra, they can be efficiently enhanced when cross-correlating with tracers of the dark matter distribution such as galaxies in the 2MASS catalogues. We show that the planned four-years eROSITA all-sky survey will provide a large enough photon statistics to potentially yield very stringent constraints on the decay lifetime, enabling to firmly test the recently claimed 3.56-keV X-ray line found towards several clusters and galaxies and its decaying dark matter interpretation. However, we also show that in order to fully exploit the potential of eROSITA for dark matter searches, it is vital to overcome the shot-noise limitations inherent to galaxy catalogues as tracers for the dark matter distribution.","astro-ph.CO,astro-ph.HE,hep-ph",2015,human

However, predicting mortality in healthcare remains a significant challenge, with existing studies often focusing on specific diseases or limited predictor sets. This study evaluates machine learning models for all-cause in-hospital mortality prediction using the MIMIC-III database, employing a comprehensive feature engineering approach. Guided by clinical expertise and literature, we extracted key features such as vital signs (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), laboratory results (e.g., creatinine, glucose), and demographic information. The Random Forest model achieved the highest performance with an AUC of 0.94, significantly outperforming other machine learning and deep learning approaches. This demonstrates Random Forest's robustness in handling high-dimensional, noisy clinical data and its potential for developing effective clinical decision support tools.

This work presents an all-polarization-maintaining Yb-doper fiber laser oscillator that operates in a dispersion-managed dissipative soliton regime, thanks to incorporating a chirped fiber Bragg grating. The oscillator, mode-locked via a nonlinear optical loop mirror, has an unconventional semi-linear cavity of net anomalous dispersion. Unlike in standard ring resonators, the ultrashort pulse undergoes amplification twice per cavity roundtrip.

Our observations include transparency-resonance lifetimes more than three times the single loaded cavity, Fano-type lineshapes, and stepwise control of the coherent cavity-cavity interference. Our system, with wavelength-scale localization and coupled to a single waveguide, is analyzed well through the coupled-mode formalism which examines the delay in both transparency- and Fano-like lineshapes.

The primary challenge is to extract degradation representations from the input degraded images and use them to guide the model's adaptation to specific degradation types. Building on the insight that various degradations affect image content differently across frequency bands, we propose a new dual-transformer approach comprising two components: a frequency-aware Degradation estimation transformer (Dformer) and a degradation-adaptive Restoration transformer (Rformer). The Dformer captures the essential characteristics of various degradations by decomposing the input into different frequency components. By understanding how degradations affect these frequency components, the Dformer learns robust priors that effectively guide the restoration process. The Rformer then employs a degradation-adaptive self-attention module to selectively focus on the most affected frequency components, guided by the learned degradation representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in five representative restoration tasks, including denoising, deraining, dehazing, deblurring, and low-light enhancement.

We study a natural model for online team formation, where a principal repeatedly partitions a group of agents into teams. Agents have binary latent types, each team comprises two members, and a team's performance is a symmetric function of its members' types. Over multiple rounds, the principal selects matchings over agents and incurs regret equal to the deficit in the number of successful teams versus the optimal matching for the given function. Our work provides a complete characterization of the regret landscape for all symmetric functions of two binary inputs.

We analyze how the injected quantities can be controlled through the parameters of the incident light fields, allowing capabilities of control beyond those achieved with static fields, and discuss the conditions for experimental verification of our results.","cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.optics",2014,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05019v2,All-atom simulations reveal how single point mutations promote serpin misfolding,"Protein misfolding is implicated in many diseases, including the serpinopathies. For the canonical inhibitory serpin α1-antitrypsin (A1AT), mutations can result in protein deficiencies leading to lung disease, and misfolded mutants can accumulate in hepatocytes leading to liver disease. Using all-atom simulations based on the recently developed Bias Functional algorithm we elucidate how wild-type A1AT folds and how the disease-associated S (Glu264Val) and Z (Glu342Lys) mutations lead to misfolding. The deleterious Z mutation disrupts folding at an early stage, while the relatively benign S mutant shows late stage minor misfolding. A number of suppressor mutations ameliorate the effects of the Z mutation and simulations on these mutants help to elucidate the relative roles of steric clashes and electrostatic interactions in Z misfolding. These results demonstrate a striking correlation between atomistic events and disease severity and shine light on the mechanisms driving chains away from their correct folding routes.","q-bio.BM,cond-mat.soft,physics.bio-ph",2017,human

For a quantum system with a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space, we first propose an adaptive protocol where only $2d-1$ measurement outcomes are used to accomplish the QST for $all$ pure states. This idea is then extended to study QPT for unitary channels, where an adaptive unitary process tomography (AUPT) protocol of $d^2+d-1$ measurement outcomes is constructed for any unitary channel. We experimentally implement the AUPT protocol in a 2-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance system. We examine the performance of the AUPT protocol when applied to Hadamard gate, $T$ gate ($π/8$ phase gate), and controlled-NOT gate, respectively, as these gates form the universal gate set for quantum information processing purpose. As a comparison, standard QPT is also implemented for each gate. Our experimental results show that the AUPT protocol that reconstructing unitary channels via adaptive measurements significantly reduce the number of experiments required by standard QPT without considerable loss of fidelity.",quant-ph,2016,human

For one of these actions, $S$, the fluid four--velocity is expressed as a sum of products of scalar fields and their gradients (the velocity--potential representation). For the other action, ${\bar S}$, the fluid four--velocity is proportional to the totally antisymmetric product of gradients of the fluid Lagrangian coordinates. The relationship between $S$ and ${\bar S}$ is established by expressing $S$ in Hamiltonian form and identifying certain canonical coordinates as ignorable. Elimination of these coordinates and their conjugates yields the action ${\bar S}$. The key step in the analysis is a point canonical transformation in which all tensor fields on space are expressed in terms of the Lagrangian coordinate system supplied by the fluid. The canonical transformation is of interest in its own right. It can be applied to any physical system that includes a material medium described by Lagrangian coordinates. The result is a Hamiltonian description of the system in which the momentum constraint is trivial.",gr-qc,1994,human

Existing all-in-one restoration (AIR) approaches either depend on external text prompts or embed hand-crafted architectural priors (e.g., frequency heuristics); both impose discrete, brittle assumptions that weaken generalization to unseen or mixed degradations. To address this limitation, we propose to reframe AIR as learned latent prior inference, where degradation-aware representations are automatically inferred from the input without explicit task cues. Based on latent priors, we formulate AIR as a structured reasoning paradigm: (1) which features to route (adaptive feature selection), (2) where to restore (spatial localization), and (3) what to restore (degradation semantics). We design a lightweight decoding module that efficiently leverages these latent encoded cues for spatially-adaptive restoration. Extensive experiments across six common degradation tasks, five compound settings, and previously unseen degradations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, achieving an average PSNR improvement of 1.68 dB while being three times more efficient.",cs.CV,2025,human

The truncated solver method with bias correction and the coherent source sequential propagator construction are used to cost-effectively achieve $O(10^5)$ measurements on each ensemble. Using these data, the analysis of two-point correlation functions is extended to include four states in the fits and of three-point functions to three states. Control over excited-state contamination in the calculation of the nucleon mass, the mass gaps between excited states, and in the matrix elements is demonstrated by the consistency of estimates using this multistate analysis of the spectral decomposition of the correlation functions and from simulations of the three-point functions at multiple values of the source-sink separation.

Such corrections, which are usually referred to as kinematic, can be defined as contributions of operators of all twists that can be reduced to total derivatives of the leading twist operators. As the principal result, we provide a set of projection operators that pick up the ""kinematic"" part of an arbitrary flavor-nonsinglet twist-four operator in QCD. A complete expression is derived for the time-ordered product of two electromagnetic currents that includes all kinematic corrections to twist-four accuracy. The results are immediately applicable to the studies of deeply-virtual Compton scattering, transition gamma^*-> M gamma form factors and related processes.

Gauge consistency is restored by introducing one vectorlike lepton family and singlet scalars whose vacuum expectation values both break $U(1)'_{\ell}$ and generate masses for the new gauge boson $Z_{\ell}$ and the heavy leptons.   We derive compact anomaly-cancellation conditions, closed-form $Z_{\ell}$ couplings and decay widths, and the structure of gauge--kinetic mixing, including the trace condition $\mathrm{Tr}(YQ')=0$ that suppresses radiative mixing. The setup naturally embeds a type-I seesaw for neutrino masses and provides a stable singlet field as a minimal dark-matter candidate. Collider and precision constraints are expressed analytically over the full parameter space, covering pure leptophilic production, small-mixing hadron colliders, and the contact-interaction limit $M_{Z_{\ell}}\!\gg\!\sqrt{s}$.

Lüscher F-terms are organised in powers of the exponential suppression factor exp(-Delta/2h)^m, and we calculate all terms in this series, matching one-loop algebraic curve results from our previous paper arXiv:1006.2174. Starting with the second term, the structure of these terms is different to those in AdS_5 x S^5 thanks to the appearance of heavy modes in the loop, which can here be interpreted as two-particle bound states in the mirror theory. By contrast, physical bound states can represent dyonic giant magnons, and we also calculate F-terms for these solutions. Lüscher mu-terms, suppressed by exp(-Delta/E), instead give at leading order the classical finite-size correction. For an elementary dyonic giant magnon, we recover the correction given by arXiv:0903.3365. We then extend this to calculate the next term in 1/h, giving a one-loop prediction.

Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we studied premelting layers at the basal face of ice in contact with styrene-butadiene rubber from 254 to 269 K. Despite its hydrophobicity, rubber enhances structural disorder of interfacial water, promoting premelting. In contrast, water mobility is suppressed by confinement from polymer chains, leading to glassy dynamics distinct from the ice-vapor interface. Near the melting point, rubber chains become more flexible and penetrate the premelting layer, forming a mixed rubber-water region that couples the dynamics of both components. These results suggest that nanoscale roughness and morphology of hydrophobic polymers disrupt ice hydrogen-bond networks, thereby enhancing premelting.

While adaptive prompt learning enables end-to-end optimization, it often yields overlapping or redundant task representations. Conversely, explicit prompts derived from pretrained classifiers enhance discriminability but discard critical visual information needed for reconstruction. To address these limitations, we introduce Contrastive Prompt Learning (CPL), a framework that aims to improve prompt-task alignment through two complementary components: a Sparse Prompt Module (SPM) that efficiently captures degradation-aware representations while reducing redundancy, and a Contrastive Prompt Regularization (CPR) that explicitly strengthens task boundaries by incorporating negative prompt samples across different degradation types. Unlike previous approaches that focus primarily on degradation classification, CPL directly optimizes the interaction between prompts and the restoration model. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks show that CPL consistently boosts the performance of strong AiOIR baselines across diverse scenarios. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art average performance on these benchmarks, providing a general and robust solution for AiOIR.

In almost all close encounters the energy and angular momentum transfer is dominated by disc material becoming unbound from the system, with the contributions from close disc particle -- star encounters being significant. For more distant encounters with some prograde element to the motion the disc material loses energy and angular momentum to the perturber's orbit through a resonance feature. The magnitude of the energy transfer calculated in our simulations is greater than that of the binding energy of material exterior to periastron by a factor of two in the prograde case, and up to a factor of five in the case of the retrograde encounter. The destructive nature of the encounters indicates that a non-linear treatment is essential in all but the most distant encounters.",astro-ph,1995,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01786v1,Real-time full-field imaging through scattering media by all-optical feedback,"Full-field imaging through scattering media is fraught with many challenges. Despite many achievements in recent years, current imaging methods are too slow to deal with fast dynamics that occur for example in biomedical imaging. Here we present an ultra-fast all-optical method, where the object to be imaged and the scattering medium (diffuser) are inserted into a highly multimode self-imaging laser cavity. We show that the intra-cavity laser light from the object is mainly focused onto specific regions of the scattering medium where the phase variations are low. Thus, round trip loss within the laser cavity is minimized, thereby overcoming most of the scattering effects. The method is exploited to image objects through scattering media whose diffusion angle is lower than the numerical aperture of the laser cavity. As our method is based on optical feedback inside a laser cavity, it can deal with temporal variations that occur on timescales as short as several cavity round trips, with an upper bound of 200 ns.",physics.optics,2021,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08253v2,All-Optical Azimuthal Trapping of Dissipative Kerr Multi-Solitons for Relative Noise Suppression,"Temporal cavity solitons, or dissipative Kerr solitons (DKS) in integrated microresonators, are essential for deployable metrology technologies. Such applications favor the lowest noise state, typically the single-DKS state where one soliton is in the resonator. Other multi-DKS states can also be reached, offering better conversion efficiency and thermal stability, potentially simplifying DKS-based technologies. Yet they exhibit more noise due to relative soliton jitter, and are usually not compatible with targeted applications. We demonstrate that Kerr-induced synchronization, an all-optical trapping technique, can azimuthally pin the multi-DKS state to a common reference field. This method ensures repetition rate noise independent of the number of solitons, making a multi-DKS state indistinguishable from a single-DKS state in that regard, akin to trapped-soliton molecule behavior. Supported by theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration in an integrated microresonator, this approach provides metrological capacity regardless of the number of cavity solitons, benefiting numerous DKS-based metrology applications.","physics.optics,physics.app-ph",2024,human

Regarding the former, we prove that, for every d, the number of n-dimensional representations of $SL(d,\mathbb{Z}_p)$ grows slower than $n^{22}$, confirming a conjecture of Larsen and Lubotzky. Regarding the latter, we prove that the moduli space of $SL(d)$-local systems on a smooth projective curve of genus at least 12 has rational singularities. Most of our results apply more generally to semi-simple algebraic groups.   For the proof, we study the analytic properties of push forwards of smooth measures under algebraic maps. More precisely, we show that such push forwards have continuous density if the algebraic map is flat and all of its fibers have rational singularities.","math.AG,math.GR,math.RT",2013,human

In this work, we propose an all-optical reservoir, consisting of integrated double-ring resonators (DRRs) as nodes, for fast and accurate optical packet header recognition. As the delay-bandwidth product (DBP) of the node is a key figure-of-merit in the reservoir, we adopt a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to maximize the DBPs for various types of DRRs, which has the advantage of full parameter space optimization and fast convergence speed. Intriguingly, the optimized DBPs of the DRRs in cascaded, parallel, and embedded configurations reach the same maximum value, which is believed to be the global maximum. Finally, 3-bit and 6-bit packet header recognition tasks are performed with the all-optical reservoir consisting of the optimized cascaded rings, which have greatly reduced chip size and the desired ""flat-top"" delay spectra. Using this optical computing scheme, word-error rates as low as 5*10-4 and 9*10-4 are achieved for 3-bit and 6-bit packet header recognition tasks, respectively, which are one order of magnitude better than the previously reported values.","eess.SP,cs.AI",2023,human

Cosmic muon intensity depends on the incident angle (zenith angle). The low intensity of cosmic muon requires a long measurement time to acquire statistically meaningful counts. Therefore, high-energy particle simulations e.g., GEANT4, are often used to guide measurement studies. However, the measurable cosmic muon count rate changes upon detector geometry and configuration. Here we develop an effective solid angle model to estimate experimental results more accurately than the simple cosine-squared model. We show that the cosine-squared model has a large error at high zenith angles, whereas our model provides improved estimations at all zenith angles. We anticipate our model will enhance the ability to estimate actual measurable cosmic muon count rates in muon imaging applications by reducing the gap between simulation and measurement results. This will increase the value of modeling results and improve the quality of experiments and applications in muon detection and imaging.","physics.ins-det,hep-ex",2021,human

Their future in applications and devices hinges on their efficient manipulation and detection. Here, we explore from ab-initio their nature as magnetic inhomongeities in an otherwise unperturbed magnetic material, Fe layer covered by a thin Pd film and deposited on top of Ir(111) surface. The presence of skyrmions triggers scattering processes, from which Friedel oscillations emerge. The latter mediate interactions among skyrmions or between skyrmions and other potential surrounding defects. In contrast to their wavelengths, the amplitude of the oscillations depends strongly on the size of the skyrmion. The analogy with the scattering-off atomic defects enables the assignment of an effective scattering potential and a phase shift to the skyrmionic particles, which can be useful to predict their behavior on the basis of simple scattering frameworks. The induced charge ripples can be utilized for a noninvasive all-electrical detection of skyrmions located on a surface or even if buried a few nanometers away from the detecting electrode.",cond-mat.mes-hall,2020,human

By spectrally tuning a Fabry-Perot cavity in resonance with a target cavity, the quality factor and the local density of states experienced by emitters in the target cavity are modified, leading to a change in the SE rate. From the theoretical analysis of the coupled-cavity quantum electrodynamics system, the SE rate change can be higher than the quality factor change due to a reduction of the vacuum field at the emitter's position when the two cavities are brought in resonance. Both the weak and strong coupling regimes of two cavities have been observed experimentally and the SE decay rate has been modified by more than a factor of three with remote optical control.","cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.optics,quant-ph",2012,human

The system is modeled using a multimode extension of the Lang-Kobayashi equations with injected optical pulses. We uncover the bifurcation structure by deriving analytical expressions for the boundaries of the bistable region and demonstrate how the delay time in the external cavity determines an optimal pulse duration for efficient switching of the memory element. We also show the relevant role played by gain saturation and by the dual-mode solutions of the Lang-Kobayashi equations for the existence of the bistable regions. Our results demonstrate that feedback induced bistability can lead to significant performance improvements when compared to memory elements based on the injection locking bistability in dual-mode devices.,physics.optics,2012,human

The observed conversion is induced by a control beam and due to the Kerr effect, resulting in a transient index grating which coherently scatters probe light from one transverse waveguide mode into another. We introduce birefringent phase matching to enable efficient all-optically induced mode conversion at different wavelengths of the control and probe beam. It is shown that tailoring the waveguide geometry can be exploited to explicitly minimize intermodal group delay as well as to maximize the nonlinear coefficient, under the constraint of a phase matching condition.

Tetragonal distortions (\b{eta}-phase) trigger preferential crystallographic alignment within polycrystalline ensembles, a feature we suggest is coordinated across multiple neighboring grains via interfacial forces that select for certain lattice distortions over others. External anisotropy is then imposed on polycrystalline thin films of orthorhombic (γ-phase) CsPbI3-xBrx perovskite via substrate clamping, revealing two fundamental uniaxial texture formations; (i) I-rich films possess orthorhombic-like texture (<100> out-of-plane; <010> and <001> in-plane), while (ii) Br-rich films form tetragonal-like texture (<110> out-of-plane; <1-10> and <001> in-plane).

We study the enumeration problem for annotated grammars: fixing a grammar, and given a string as input, enumerate all annotations of the string that form a word derivable from the grammar. Our first result is an algorithm for unambiguous annotated grammars, which preprocesses the input string in cubic time and enumerates all annotations with output-linear delay. This improves over Peterfreund's result, which needs quintic time preprocessing to achieve this delay bound. We then study how we can reduce the preprocessing time while keeping the same delay bound, by making additional assumptions on the grammar. Specifically, we present a class of grammars which only have one derivation shape for all outputs, for which we can enumerate with quadratic time preprocessing. We also give classes that generalize regular spanners for which linear time preprocessing suffices.","cs.FL,cs.DS",2022,human

Young main-sequence stars are known to be the dominant contributor in stellar X-ray selected samples at the limiting flux levels of the RASS, yet they appear to be very rare in the RASS samples discussed here.

In photonics, when it is crucial to implement topological photonic devices on a chip, two major challenges are associated with electromagnetic dissipation into heat and out-of-plane radiation into free space. Both these mechanisms may destroy the topological state and seriously affect the device performance. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the topological order for light can be implemented in all-dielectric on-chip prototype metasurfaces, which mitigate the effect of Ohmic losses by using exclusively dielectric materials, and reveal that coupling of the system to the radiative continuum does not affect the topological properties.

Specifically, we propose an efficient supernet-based neural architecture search (NAS) method that uses search space pruning. The search space defined by the supernet is pruned by removing candidate models that are predicted to perform poorly. To effectively remove the candidates over a wide range of resource constraints, we particularly design a performance predictor for supernet, called path filter, which is conditioned by resource constraints and can accurately predict the relative performance of the models that satisfy similar resource constraints. Hence, supernet training is more focused on the best-performing candidates. Our path filter handles prediction for paths with different resource budgets. Compared to once-for-all, our proposed method reduces the computational cost of the optimal network architecture by 30% and 63%, while yielding better accuracy-floating point operations Pareto front (0.85 and 0.45 points of improvement on average precision for Pascal VOC and COCO, respectively).",cs.CV,2023,human

This is why this paper presents an original alternative to this approach through norm-homotopy optimization. This approach, combined with an efficient technique to compute the structural response, is shown to outperform direct $H_\infty$ optimization in terms of speed and performance.

This requires generalizing the angle structures program of Casson and Rivin for triangulations with a mixture of finite, ideal, and truncated (i.e. ultra-ideal) vertices. A consequence of this decomposition is that the volumes of spherical tiling links are precisely twice the maximal volumes of the ideal Archimedean solids of the same combinatorial description. In the case of hyperbolic tiling links, we are led to consider links embedded in thickened surfaces S_g x I with genus g at least 2. We generalize the bipyramid construction of Adams to truncated bipyramids and use them to prove that the set of possible volume densities for links in S_g x I, ranging over all g at least 2, is a dense subset of the interval [0, 2v_{oct}], where v_{oct}, approximately 3.66386, is the volume of the regular ideal octahedron.",math.GT,2016,human

http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2257v2,Explicitly Broken Supersymmetry with Exactly Massless Moduli,"There is an avatar of the little hierarchy problem of the MSSM in 3-dimensional supersymmetry. We propose a solution to this problem in AdS$_3$ based on the AdS/CFT correspondence. The bulk theory is a supergravity theory in which U(1) $\times$ U(1) R-symmetry is gauged by Chern-Simons fields. The bulk theory is deformed by a boundary term quadratic in the gauge fields. It breaks SUSY completely and sources an exactly marginal operator in the dual CFT. SUSY breaking is communicated by gauge interactions to bulk scalar fields and their spinor superpartners. Since the R-charges of scalar and spinor differ, this generates a SUSY breaking shift of their masses. The Ward identity facilitates the calculation of these mass shifts to any desired order in the strength of the deformation. Moduli fields are massless $R$-neutral bulk scalars with vanishing potential in the undeformed theory. These properties are maintained to all orders in the deformation despite the fact that moduli couple in the bulk to loops of R-charged fields.","hep-th,hep-ph",2014,human

While geography may be important, it may not be all-important, for at least two reasons. First, technology helps bridge distance, so that regions separated by large distances may be more similar than would be expected based on geographical distance. Second, geographical, political, and social divisions can make neighboring regions dissimilar. We develop a flexible Bayesian approach for learning from spatial data which units are close in an unobserved socio-demographic space and hence which units are similar. As a by-product, the Bayesian approach helps quantify the relative importance of socio-demographic space relative to geographical space.

In this paper we define derivatives of all order for smooth admissible Frechet representations (of moderate growth). The archimedean case is more problematic than the p-adic case; for example arbitrary derivatives need not be admissible. However, the highest derivative continues being admissible, and for irreducible unitarizable representations coincides with the space of smooth vectors of the adduced representation. In [AGS] we prove exactness of the highest derivative functor, and compute highest derivatives of all monomial representations.   We prove exactness of the highest derivative functor, and compute highest derivatives of all monomial representations.

In this work, we experimentally evidence the interfacial DMI in a 7~nm-thick YIG film by measuring the nonreciprocal spin wave propagation in terms of frequency, amplitude and most importantly group velocities using all electrical spin-wave spectroscopy. The velocities of propagating spin waves show chirality among three vectors, i.e. the film normal direction, applied field and spin-wave wavevector. By measuring the asymmetric group velocities, we extract a DMI constant of 16~$μ$J/m$^{2}$ which we independently confirm by Brillouin light scattering. Thickness-dependent measurements reveal that the DMI originates from the oxide interface between the YIG and garnet substrate. The interfacial DMI discovered in the ultrathin YIG films is of key importance for functional chiral magnonics as ultra-low spin-wave damping can be achieved.","cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.mes-hall",2019,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05096v1,Multiple simultaneous solution representations in a population based evolutionary algorithm,"The representation used for solutions in optimization can have a significant impact on the performance of the optimization method. Traditional population based evolutionary methods have homogeneous populations where all solutions use the same representation. If different representations are to be considered, different runs are required to investigate the relative performance. In this paper, we illustrate the use of a population based evolutionary method, Fresa, inspired by the propagation of Strawberry plants, which allows for multiple representations to co-exist in the population.   Fresa is implemented in the Julia language. Julia provides dynamic typing and multiple dispatch. In multiple dispatch, the function invoked is determined, dynamically at run time, by the types of the arguments passed to it. This enables a generic implementation of key steps in the plant propagation algorithm which allows for a heterogeneous population. The search procedure then leads to a competition between representations automatically.   A simple case study from the design of operating conditions for a batch reactor system is used to illustrate heterogeneous population based search.","cs.NE,eess.SY",2021,human

Early observers such as Galileo Galilei interpreted these disks as being the physical bodies of stars; later observers such as William Herschel understood them to be spurious; some, such as Christian Huygens, argued that stars show no disks at all. In the early 19th century George B. Airy produced a theoretical explanation of star images sufficient to explain all historical observations, but astronomers were slow to fully recognize this. Even today conventional wisdom concerning stars and telescopes stands at odds to both historical observations and Airy's theory. We give a detailed analysis of both historical observations and Airy's theory, illustrating how Airy's theory explains the historical observations, from Galileo to Huygens to Herschel.

The novelty of the search lies in the use of a non-coherent technique based on the Hough-transform to combine the information from coherent searches on timescales of about one day. Because these searches are very computationally intensive, they have been deployed on the Einstein@Home distributed computing project infrastructure. The search presented here is about a factor 3 more sensitive than the previous Einstein@Home search in early S5 LIGO data. The post-processing has left us with eight surviving candidates. We show that deeper follow-up studies rule each of them out. Hence, since no statistically significant gravitational wave signals have been detected, we report upper limits on the intrinsic gravitational wave amplitude h0. For example, in the 0.5 Hz-wide band at 152.5 Hz, we can exclude the presence of signals with h0 greater than 7.6 x 10^-25 with a 90% confidence level.","gr-qc,astro-ph.IM",2012,human

With this comagnetometer system, we set the constraint on the strength of spin-gravity coupling of the proton at a level of $10^{-18}$ eV, comparable to the most stringent one. With further optimization in magnetic field stabilization and spin polarization, the systematic errors can be effectively suppressed, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved, promising to set more stringent constraints on spin-gravity interactions.","physics.atom-ph,physics.app-ph,physics.ins-det,physics.optics",2020,human

The proper design of half adder results in no need to increase the intensity of the input optical signal for the appearance of the nonlinear Kerr effect, which leads to diverting the incoming light toward the desired output. The proposed device consists of four optical waveguides and a defect in a square lattice PhC.

The presented structure, the ON-OFF contrast ratios for Sum and Carry, are 16dB and 14dB, respectively. Our simulation results reveal the proposed half adder has a maximum delay time of 0.7 ps with a total footprint of 158 um2. Due to very low delay time, high contrast ratio, and small footprint that they are more crucial in modern optoelectronic technologies, this structure can be used in the next generation of all-optical high-speed central processing units.","physics.optics,physics.app-ph",2020,human

To this end, we propose LightHuBERT, a once-for-all Transformer compression framework, to find the desired architectures automatically by pruning structured parameters. More precisely, we create a Transformer-based supernet that is nested with thousands of weight-sharing subnets and design a two-stage distillation strategy to leverage the contextualized latent representations from HuBERT. Experiments on automatic speech recognition (ASR) and the SUPERB benchmark show the proposed LightHuBERT enables over $10^9$ architectures concerning the embedding dimension, attention dimension, head number, feed-forward network ratio, and network depth. LightHuBERT outperforms the original HuBERT on ASR and five SUPERB tasks with the HuBERT size, achieves comparable performance to the teacher model in most tasks with a reduction of 29% parameters, and obtains a $3.5\times$ compression ratio in three SUPERB tasks, e.g., automatic speaker verification, keyword spotting, and intent classification, with a slight accuracy loss.

The coupling between tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) and tunnel electroresistance (TER) in MFTJs can provide four distinct resistive states in a single memory cell. Here we show that in an all-oxide asymmetric MFTJ of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 /PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 /La0.7Te0.3MnO3 (LSMO/PZT/LTMO) with p-type and n-type electrodes, the intrinsic rectification is observed and can be modified by the ferroelectric polarization of PZT. Owing to the combined TMR, TER and diode effects, two different groups of four resistive states under opposite reading biases are performed. With two parallel asymmetric junctions and the appropriate series resistance, the coexistence of logic units and quaternary memory cells can be realized in the same array devices. The asymmetric MFTJ structure enables more possibilities for designing next generation of multi-states memory and logical devices with higher storage density, lower energy consumption and significantly increased integration level.",cond-mat.mtrl-sci,2019,human

The lattice size is fixed at $32^3\times64$ with a lattice cutoff scale of 1.37(1) GeV. For the calculations with $M_π= 170$ MeV, we employed the All-Mode-Averaging (AMA) technique, which led to roughly a factor of 20 improvement in computational efficiency and has reduced the statistical errors in our results significantly. We were also able to do calculations at two different source-sink separations, at roughly 1.3 fm and 1.0 fm, without much additional cost by reusing the low eigen-modes stored for the AMA calculations. We will present results for the isovector form factors and their derived quantities, including the Dirac and Pauli radii, anomalous magnetic moment and discuss the effects of possible excited-state contaminations. Connected contributions to the isoscalar Dirac and Pauli form factors will also be shown.",hep-lat,2014,human

Yet, the access to triplet states would open up a route towards an all-optical single-molecule photonic switch/transistor and, moreover, would provide a way of performing coherent spin operations from the spin-less ground state. In this work, we take an important step towards those aims by measuring the triplet energy from the weak phosphorescence signal of perdeuterated perylene, embedded as a guest molecule in a dibenzothiophene host matrix, which well preserves the coherence properties of the perylene guest. We find that perylene's phosphorescence can be enhanced in this host matrix, when acting as an intermediary for the generation of triplet excitons. The triplet energy that we find can be used to significantly narrow down the search for the ultra-weak spin-forbidden transitions from the ground singlet to the triplet states of a single molecule.","physics.chem-ph,physics.optics",2025,human

Formulation and application to the electronic structure of semiconductors,"We have implemented the so called GW approximation (GWA) based on an all-electron full-potential Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method. For the screening of the Coulomb interaction W we tested three different plasmon-pole dielectric function models, and showed that the accuracy of the quasiparticle energies is not sensitive to the the details of these models. We have then applied this new method to compute the quasiparticle band structure of some small, medium and large-band-gap semiconductors: Si, GaAs, AlAs, InP, SiMg$_2$, C and (insulator) LiCl. A special attention was devoted to the convergence of the self-energy with respect to both the {\bf k}-points in the Brillouin zone and to the number of reciprocal space $\bf G$-vectors. The most important result is that although the all-electron GWA improves considerably the quasiparticle band structure of semiconductors, it does not always provide the correct energy band gaps as originally claimed by GWA pseudopotential type of calculations. We argue that the decoupling between the valence and core electrons is a problem, and is some what hidden in a pseudopotential type of approach.","cond-mat.mtrl-sci,cond-mat.str-el",1999,human

Yet, from a cryptographer's point of view, authentication is at least as important as a secure exchange of keys. Adding an authentication via hashing e.g. is straightforward but with no relation to Neural Cryptography. We consequently formulate an authenticated key exchange within this concept. Another alternative, integrating a Zero-Knowledge protocol into the synchronisation, is also presented. A Man-In-The-Middle attack and even all currently known attacks, that are based on using identically structured TPMs and synchronisation as well, can so be averted. This in turn has practical consequences on using the trajectory in weight space.

Such devices support very strong magnetic, as well as electric, resonances, and are free of ohmic losses that severely limit the performance of their plasmonic counterparts. However, the functionality of dielectric-based metasurfaces is fixed-by-design, i.e. the optical response is fixed by the size, arrangement and index of the nanoresonators. A far wider range of applications could be addressed if active/reconfigurable control were possible. We demonstrate this here, via a new hybrid metasurface concept in which active control is achieved by embedding deeply sub-wavelength inclusions of a tuneable chalcogenide phase-change material within the body of high-index Si nanocylinders. Moreover, by strategic placement of the phase-change layer, and switching of its phase-state, we show selective and active control of metasuface resonances.

Both observations occurred during a low state of the X-ray source when the outer parts of the accretion disk blocked the neutron star from view. The orbital modulation of the X-ray flux was detected during the low states. We argue that the detected X-ray radiation results from scattering of the emission of the central source by three distinct regions: (a) an optically thin hot corona with temperature $\sim (2-4) \times 10^6$ K above the irradiated hemisphere of the optical star; (b) an optically thin hot halo above the accretion disk; and (c) the optically thick cold atmosphere of the optical star.

Firstly, we extend the standard coupled-mode theory analysis to photonic crystal structures and obtain explicit analytical expressions for the bistability thresholds and transmission coefficients which provide the basis for a detailed understanding of the possibilities associated with these structures. Next, we discuss limitations of standard coupled-mode theory and present an alternative analytical approach based on the effective discrete equations derived using a Green's function method. We find that the discrete nature of the photonic crystal waveguides allows a novel, geometry-driven enhancement of nonlinear effects by shifting the resonator location relative to the waveguide, thus providing an additional control of resonant waveguide transmission and Fano resonances. We further demonstrate that this enhancement may result in the lowering of the bistability threshold and switching power of nonlinear devices by several orders of magnitude. Finally, we show that employing such enhancements is of paramount importance for the design of all-optical devices based on slow-light photonic crystal waveguides.",physics.optics,2006,human

We have designed sandwich heterostructures of (Zn,Cr)Te/(Bi,Sb)2Te3/(Zn,Cr)Te that fulfills two prerequisites for the emergence of the QAHE; the formation of a sizable exchange gap at the TI surface state and the tuning of the Fermi energy into the exchange gap. The efficient proximity coupling in the all-telluride based heterostructure as demonstrated here will enable a realistic design of versatile tailor-made topological materials coupled with ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity, superconductivity, and so on.","cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mtrl-sci",2019,human

Current X-ray sources for micro-focus CT are typically limited by their relatively low photon energy and low flux. An all-optical inverse Compton scattering source (AOCS) based on laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) can generate intense quasi-monoenergetic X/gamma-ray pulses in the keV-MeV range with micron-level source size, and its potential application for micro-focus CT has become very attractive in recent years due to the fast pace progress made in LWFA. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of high-fidelity micro-focus CT using AOCS (~70 keV) by imaging and reconstructing a test object with complex inner structures. A region-of-interest (ROI) CT method is adopted to utilize the relatively small field-of-view (FOV) of AOCS to obtain high-resolution reconstruction. This demonstration of the ROI micro-focus CT based on AOCS is a key step for its application in the field of hyperfine nondestructive testing.","physics.app-ph,physics.acc-ph",2020,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9706155v1,The Steepness Ratio Technique: A New Method to analyze ROSAT All-Sky Survey Extended Sources,"In this first paper of a series we develop a new technique to analyze clusters of galaxies observed during the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS). We call this method the Steepness Ratio Technique (SRT). The SRT uses the convolution between the real RASS point-spread function and the cluster emission profile assumed to be a beta-model with the beta parameter fixed to the value of 2/3. From the convolved source emission profile the SRT extracts total flux and extension (i.e., core radius) for each cluster. Using the Steepness Ratio (SR) and a control sample of RASS pointlike sources we are able to assign to each RASS source a model-independent probability of extension. Potential biases arising from the hypotheses of a beta-model emission profile and from a fixed beta value are quantified. Tests with control samples of optically identified sources extracted from both the ROSAT survey database and from the ROSAT-PSPC pointed observations archive are performed to check the SRT output. We find that the source properties derived using the SRT on RASS data are consistent with those determined from ROSAT-PSPC pointed observations.",astro-ph,1997,human

When designed with anisotropic subwavelength geometries, metasurfaces can tune responses to varying polarization states of light. Leveraging this to quantify structural alignment in fibrous materials unveils an alternative to destructive characterization methods. This work introduces metasurface-enhanced polarized light microscopy (Meta-PoL), which employs polarization-tunable, guided-mode-resonant colorimetric metasurfaces to characterize molecular and bulk alignment of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) nanofibers in a far-field configuration. PCL nanofibers drawn at 0%, 400%, and 900% ratios were interfaced with the studied metasurfaces. Metasurface resonances coinciding with the intrinsic drawn nanofiber resonances - confirmed by Stokes Polarimetry - produced the strongest colorimetric enhancement, resultant from alignment-specific nanofiber reflectivity. The enhancement degree corresponded with molecular and bulk alignments for each draw ratio, as measured through differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Thus, Meta-PoL presents an all-optical, non-destructive, and quantitative measurement of nanofiber alignment.",physics.optics,2025,human

However, the lack of room-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetic crystals with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy has greatly hindered the development of vertical MTJs. The discovery of room-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetic 2D crystal Fe3GaTe2 has solved the problem and greatly facilitated the realization of practical spintronic devices. Here, we demonstrate a room-temperature MTJ based on Fe3GaTe2/WS2/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. The tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio is up to 213% with high spin polarization of 72% at 10 K, the highest ever reported in Fe3GaTe2-based MTJs up to now. The tunnelling spin-valve signal robustly exists at room temperature (300 K) with bias current down to 10 nA. Moreover, the spin polarization can be modulated by bias current and the TMR shows a sign reversal at large bias current.

Two distinct mechanisms have been observed, where the final magnetization state is either defined by the helicity of many incoming laser pulses, or toggled by a single pulse. What has thus far been elusive, yet essential for applications, is the deterministic writing of a specific magnetization state with a single laser pulse. In this work we experimentally demonstrate such a mechanism by making use of a spin polarized current which is optically generated in a ferromagnetic reference layer, assisting or hindering switching in an adjacent Co/Gd bilayer. We show deterministic writing of an 'up' and 'down' state using a sequence of 1 or 2 pulses, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate the non-local origin of the effect by varying the magnitude of the generated spin current.

The Bethe-Salpeter Equation is used to calculate both the screened Coulomb interaction $\hat W$ in the quasiparticle band structure and the imaginary part of the macroscopic dielectric function. The convergence of the quasiparticle band gap and lowest exciton peak position is studied as function of the separation of the monolayers when using periodic boundary conditions. The quasiparticle gap is found to vary as $1/d$ with $d$ the size of the vacuum separation, while the excitonic lowest peak reaches convergence much faster. The nature of the exciton spectrum is analyzed and shows several excitonic peaks below the quasiparticle gap when a sufficient number of $\textbf{k}$ points is used.

Some experimental efforts to test EPR steering in terms of inequalities have been made, which usually require many measurement settings. Analogy to the ""All-Versus-Nothing"" (AVN) proof of Bell's theorem without inequalities, testing steerability without inequalities would be more strong and require less resource. Moreover, the practical meaning of steering implies that it should also be possible to store the state information on the side to be steered, a result that has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. Using a recent AVN criterion for two qubit entangled states, we experimentally implement a practical steering game using quantum memory. Further more, we develop a theoretical method to deal with the noise and finite measurement statistics within the AVN framework and apply it to analyze the experimental data. Our results clearly show the facilitation of the AVN criterion for testing steerability and provide a particularly strong perspective for understanding EPR steering.",quant-ph,2015,human

However, to achieve negative refraction of highly squeezed polaritons, such as plasmon polaritons in graphene and phonon polaritons in boron nitride (BN) with their wavelengths squeezed by a factor over 100, requires the ability to flip the sign of their group velocity at will, which is challenging. Here we reveal that the strong coupling between plasmon and phonon polaritons in graphene-BN heterostructures can be used to flip the sign of the group velocity of the resulting hybrid (plasmon-phonon-polariton) modes. We predict all-angle negative refraction between plasmon and phonon polaritons, and even more surprisingly, between hybrid graphene plasmons, and between hybrid phonon polaritons. Graphene-BN heterostructures thus provide a versatile platform for the design of nano-metasurfaces and nano-imaging elements.",physics.optics,2016,human

In particular, we show that for higher orthogonal SO(N), N > 6, and for all exceptional groups the moduli space of flat connections involves several distinct connected components.

Different experiments can show a positive effect, a negative effect, or no effect at all. The same experiment may show both trends for the same substance depending on temperature, or for different substances at the same temperature. We show how this ambiguous effect naturally arises from the competition of two contributions: nonisothermal effects and pressure-volume work. Our model clarifies seemingly contradictory experimental results and quantifies the variation of the nucleation ability of a substance in the presence of an ambient gas. Our findings are corroborated by results from molecular dynamics simulation and might have important implications since nucleation in experiments, technical applications, and nature practically always occurs in the presence of an ambient gas.",cond-mat.stat-mech,2008,human

While the standard discussion of the time crystallization phenomenon is based on the notion of the global phase and genuine condensate, for the superfluidity to take place in two dimensions an algebraic (topological) order is sufficient. We find that the absence of long-range order in a finite-temperature two-dimensional superfluid translates into in an algebraic time crystallization caused by the temporal phase correlations. The exponent controlling the algebraic decay is a universal function of the superfluid-stiffness-to-temperature ratio; this exponent can be also seen in the power-law singularity of the Fourier spectrum of the AC Josephson current. We elaborate on subtleties involved in defining the phenomenon of time crystallization in both classical-filed and all-quantum cases and propose an experimental protocol in which the broken time translation symmetry---more precisely, temporal correlations of the relative phase, with all possible finite-size, dimensional, and quantum effects included---can be observed without permanently keeping two superfluids in a contact.","cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.quant-gas,cond-mat.supr-con",2017,human

We find that current-driven domain wall velocities over 2000 m/s at room temperature, achieved by compensating the total angular momentum through layer thickness tuning. Furthermore, analytical modeling of the CIDWM reveals that Joule heating needs to be treated transiently to properly describe the CIDWM for our sub-ns current pulses.

Here we present high-fidelity digital quantum simulations of flat-band (FB) and all-bands-flat (ABF) lattices, using an advanced tensor-network-based circuit compression method. With the compressed quantum circuits, we first explore single-particle dynamics and observe two distinct behaviours: strong localization in ABF lattices and delocalization in FB lattices. By integrating FB and ABF lattices into a one-dimensional hybrid structure, we achieve controllable quantum transport, where the ABF lattice acts as a quantum switch. Extending to two-particle dynamics, we show that transport remains controllable by tuning the hopping amplitude alone, even in the presence of interactions. These results establish flat-band engineered systems as a promising pathway for scalable control of quantum transport in emerging quantum technologies, with potential applications in qubit isolation, particle trapping, and state transfer.","quant-ph,cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.str-el",2025,human

With the zero-shot segmentation capacity, SAM achieved impressive flexibility and precision on various segmentation tasks. However, the current pipeline requires manual prompts during the inference stage, which is still resource intensive for biomedical image segmentation. In this paper, instead of using prompts during the inference stage, we introduce a pipeline that utilizes the SAM, called all-in-SAM, through the entire AI development workflow (from annotation generation to model finetuning) without requiring manual prompts during the inference stage. Specifically, SAM is first employed to generate pixel-level annotations from weak prompts (e.g., points, bounding box). Then, the pixel-level annotations are used to finetune the SAM segmentation model rather than training from scratch. Our experimental results reveal two key findings: 1) the proposed pipeline surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in a nuclei segmentation task on the public Monuseg dataset, and 2) the utilization of weak and few annotations for SAM finetuning achieves competitive performance compared to using strong pixel-wise annotated data.","cs.CV,cs.LG",2023,human

As a test of the theory, we consider the ``unfolding'' of pentadecane when it is transported from a constrained all-trans conformation to a random-coil state at thermal equilibrium. The time evolution of the mean-square end-to-end distance after release of the constraint is computed both from the theory and from Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations.

Here we show the photoluminescence (PL) intensity and quantum correlation (Hanbury Brown and Twiss) measurements as a function of polarization for one- and two-emitter systems. The sample was made by implanting low concentrations of adenine (C5H5N5) into a low nitrogen chemical vapor deposition diamond. This approach yielded well-spaced regions with few nitrogen-vacancy centers. By mapping the PL intensity and quantum correlation as a function of polarization, we can distinguish two emitter systems from single emitters with background, providing a method to quantify the background signal at implanted sites, which might be different from off-site background levels. This approach also provides a valuable new all-optical mechanism for the determination of one or two emitter systems useful for quantum sensing, communication, and computation tasks.","quant-ph,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,physics.optics",2022,human

Its only weakness is the lack of a native electrically driven light emitter that operates CW at room temperature, exhibits a narrow linewidth in the technologically important 1300- 1600 nm wavelength window, is small and operates with low power consumption. Here, an electrically pumped all-silicon nano light source around 1300-1600 nm range is demonstrated at room temperature. Using hydrogen plasma treatment, nano-scale optically active defects are introduced into silicon, which then feed the photonic crystal nanocavity to enahnce the electrically driven emission in a device via Purcell effect. A narrow (Δλ = 0.5 nm) emission line at 1515 nm wavelength with a power density of 0.4 mW/cm2 is observed, which represents the highest spectral power density ever reported from any silicon emitter. A number of possible improvements are also discussed, that make this scheme a very promising light source for optical interconnects and other important silicon photonics applications.",physics.optics,2013,human

Nonlinear behaviour of heat transport in terms of intensity dependent thermal diffusion rate has been observed. Effects of convective heat flow have been measured at high intensities. Quantum dots have higher nonlinear refraction as compared to the corresponding nanosheet samples, presumably due to reduced dimensionality.

However, the sources responsible for the majority of the astrophysical neutrino flux remain elusive. Opening up new channels for detection can improve sensitivity and increase the discovery potential. In this work we present a new neutrino dataset relying heavily on Deep-Neural-Networks (DNN) to select cascade events produced from neutral-current interactions of all flavors and charged-current interactions with flavors other than muon-neutrino. The speed of DNN processing makes it possible to select events in near realtime with a single GPU. Cascade events have reduced angular resolution when compared to muon-neutrino events, however the resulting dataset has a lower energy threshold in the southern sky and a lower background rate. These benefits lead to an factor of 2-3 improvement in sensitivity to sources in the Southern Sky when compared to muon-neutrino datasets. This dataset is particularly promising for identifying transient neutrino sources in the Southern Sky and neutrino production from the galactic plane.",astro-ph.HE,2021,human

In our scheme, the logical state of the target bit is encoded in the relative spatial ordering of two distinguishable soliton components, while the control bits are represented by the presence or absence of external potential wells. We solve the nonlinear Schrödinger equations governing the soliton dynamics and systematically scan soliton amplitude and velocity, analyzing reflection and transmission coefficients to identify the operational conditions for Toffoli gate behavior. Our results demonstrate that introducing asymmetry in the potential wells significantly broadens the operational parameter window compared to symmetric configurations. We also investigate the impacts of varying degrees of asymmetry and soliton amplitude on gate performance. Furthermore, we examine the influence of weak inter-component coupling and confirm that it is not essential for gate operation.

Roughly speaking α is reduced to the value close to 1, because the average degree of a tree is about 2, and one is used to come in and the other is used to go out, although that does not hold true when the depth of the shortest path trees is small.

The dispersion compensation by CFBG was sufficient to reach anomalous net dispersion in the shortest laser scheme allowing us to investigate mode-locking regimes in the -0.05 ps 2 - 0.24 ps 2 net dispersion range by varying the length of the passive fiber. With this approach we demonstrate high order harmonic mode-locking at dispersion closer to zero and large energy span near-parabolic shape single pulse operation in anomalous dispersion regime.

We apply the framework in a case study to the LIRG NGC 3690 (Arp 299, Mrk 171) and compare the obtained neutrino fluxes to the current sensitivity of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Using our framework, we also conclude that the neutrino emission in the LIRG NGC 1068, recently presented as the first steady IceCube neutrino point source, cannot be explained by a starburst-driven scenario and is therefore likely dominated by the active galactic nucleus in this galaxy.

Both constructions can be iterated, yielding new mathematical species that have already found applications outside physics. However, as we show in this paper, the iterated constructions no longer yield the same mathematical species. Hence, the constructions 'mixing' and 'dilation' themselves are by no means equivalent. Concretely, when applying the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism to the second iteration, dilation produces arbitrary symmetric bipartite states, while mixing only yields the disentangled ones. All results are proven using diagrams, and hence they hold not only for quantum theory, but also for a much more general class of process theories.","quant-ph,math.CT",2018,human

For example, the degree of degeneracy of the symplectic root system determines the size of the center of G.   In this article we classify symplectic root systems over the finite field F_2, where symplectic just means isotropic. We prove that every Dynkin diagram admits, up to symplectic isomorphisms, a unique minimal symplectic root system over F_2 and thus requires a specific degree of degeneracy of the symplectic vector space. Any non-minimal symplectic root system turns out to be a quotient of a minimal one by a universal property.

Here we hybridize an optomechanical resonator with two-level emitters and successfully demonstrate all-optical dynamic control of optical transition in the two-level system by the mechanical oscillation via the cavity quantum-electrodynamics (CQED) effect. Employing copper-doped silicon nanobeam optomechanical resonators, we have observed that the spontaneous emission rate of excitons bound to copper atoms is dynamically modulated by the optically-driven mechanical oscillation within the time scale much shorter than the emission lifetime. The result is explained very well with an analytical model including the dynamic modulation of the Purcell effect and the exciton population. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a dynamic modulation of the spontaneous emission rate by mechanical oscillations. Our achievement will open up a novel field of hybrid optomechanical CQED systems in which three body--optical transitions, optical resonance modes, and mechanical resonance modes--are strongly coupled and will pave the way for novel hybrid quantum systems.",physics.optics,2019,human

The analyses presented use 2.3, 35.9 and 77.3 inverse femtobarns of data collected between 2015 and 2017. These include the first search for diboson resonances using data collected at a 13 TeV collision energy, the introduction of a new algorithm to tag vector bosons in the context of analyzing the data collected in 2016, and the development of a novel multidimensional fit improving on the sensitivity of the previous search method with up to $30\%$.

Building on previous work, architectural modifications are proposed, along with an investigation of different conditional input representations. Despite being a common choice in related works, Mel-spectrograms demonstrate to be inadequate for the given scenario. Alternatively, a novel All-Pole Gammatone filterbank (APG) with high temporal resolution is proposed. Although computational evaluation metric results would suggest that state-of-the-art GAN-based methods perform best, a perceptual evaluation via a listening test indicates that the presented NF approach (based on time domain and APG) performs best, especially at lower SNRs. On average, APG outputs are rated as having good quality, which is unmatched by the other methods, including GAN.","eess.AS,cs.SD",2022,human

We show that with growth of injected light power there is a breaking of symmetry by two ways. In the first way the symmetry is broken because of different light intensities at the defects. In the second way the intensities at the defects are equaled but phases of complex amplitudes are different. That results in a vortical power flow between the defects similar to the DC Josephson effect if the input power over the waveguide is applied and the defects are coupled. As application of these phenomena we consider the symmetry breaking for the light transmission in a T-shaped photonic waveguide with two nonlinear defects. We demonstrate as this phenomenon can be explored for all-optical switching of light transmission from the left output waveguide to the right one by application of input pulses. Finally we consider the symmetry breaking in the waveguide coupled with single defect presented however by two dipole modes.,"nlin.PS,cond-mat.mes-hall",2011,human

Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models to achieve segmentation with 360° viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings.

The stream defines a sequence of $m$ frequency vectors $x^{(1)},\ldots,x^{(m)}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ with $(x^{(t)})_i = |\{j : j\in[t], a_j = i\}|$. That is, $x^{(t)}$ is the frequency vector after seeing the first $t$ items in the stream. Much work in the streaming literature focuses on estimating some function $f(x^{(m)})$. Many applications though require obtaining estimates at time $t$ of $f(x^{(t)})$, for every $t\in[m]$. Naively this guarantee is obtained by devising an algorithm with failure probability $\ll 1/m$, then performing a union bound over all stream updates to guarantee that all $m$ estimates are simultaneously accurate with good probability. When $f(x)$ is some $\ell_p$ norm of $x$, recent works have shown that this union bound is wasteful and better space complexity is possible for the continuous monitoring problem, with the strongest known results being for $p=2$ [HTY14, BCIW16, BCINWW17].

This is a huge leap forward: it takes an entirely new generation of gravitational wave detectors to achieve a 10-fold sensitivity increase over the previous generation [citation 12]. Within the probed frequency range and aside from the detected outliers, we can exclude neutron stars with ellipticity of 1e-8 within 65 pc of Earth. We set upper limits on the gravitational wave amplitude that hold even for worst-case signal parameters. New outliers are found, some of which we are unable to associate with any instrumental cause. If any were associated with a rotating neutron star, this would likely be the fastest neutron star today.","gr-qc,astro-ph.HE",2020,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00564v3,Nucleon matrix elements from lattice QCD with all-mode-averaging and a domain-decomposed solver: an exploratory study,"We study the performance of all-mode-averaging (AMA) when used in conjunction with a locally deflated SAP-preconditioned solver, determining how to optimize the local block sizes and number of deflation fields in order to minimize the computational cost for a given level of overall statistical accuracy. We find that AMA enables a reduction of the statistical error on nucleon charges by a factor of around two at the same cost when compared to the standard method. As a demonstration, we compute the axial, scalar and tensor charges of the nucleon in $N_f=2$ lattice QCD with non-perturbatively O(a)-improved Wilson quarks, using O(10,000) measurements to pursue the signal out to source-sink separations of $t_s\sim 1.5$ fm. Our results suggest that the axial charge is suffering from a significant amount (5-10%) of excited-state contamination at source-sink separations of up to $t_s\sim 1.2$ fm, whereas the excited-state contamination in the scalar and tensor charges seems to be small.","hep-lat,physics.comp-ph",2016,human

A new hierarchical multi-stage approach is taken, supported by the computing power of the Einstein@Home project, allowing to probe more deeply than ever before. 16 million sub-threshold candidates from the initial search [LVC,arXiv:1606.09619] are followed up in three stages. None of those candidates is consistent with an isolated gravitational wave emitter, and 90% confidence level upper limits are placed on the amplitudes of continuous waves from the target population. Between 170.5 and 171 Hz we set the most constraining 90% confidence upper limit on the strain amplitude h0 at 4.3x10-25 , while at the high end of our frequency range we achieve an upper limit of 7.6x10-25.

For this purpose, we first present an ""all-versus-nothing"" proof of genuine tripartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering by demonstrating the non-existence of a hybrid local hidden state (LHS) model in the tripartite network as a motivation to our main result. A full logical contradiction of the predictions of the hybrid LHS model with quantum mechanical outcome statistics for any three-qubit generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GGHZ) states and pure W-class states is shown. Using logical contradiction, we can distinguish between the GGHZ and W-class state in a two-sided device-independent (2SDI) steering scenario. We next formulate a 2SDI steering inequality which is a generalization of the fine-grained steering inequality (FGI) derived in \cite{PKM14} for the tripartite scenario. We show that the maximum quantum violation of this tripartite FGI can be used to certify genuine entanglement of three-qubit pure states.",quant-ph,2019,human

In particular, precise conditions are given on the nonlinearity powers in this equation under which a travelling wave can be cut off to obtain a compacton. Numerous explicit examples having various profiles are derived, including a quadratic function, powers of a cosine, and powers of Jacobi $\cn$ functions, all of which are symmetric. The cosine and $\cn$ symmetric compactons have an anti-symmetric counterpart. In comparison, explicit solitary waves of the generalized KP equation are found to have profiles given by a power of a sech and a reciprocal quadratic function.

After a hundred years of development it is now routinely employed to describe, among others, quantum computers with thousands of qubits. This tremendous progress turns the debate of foundational questions into a technological imperative. In what follows we introduce a model of a quantum measurement process that consistently includes the impact of having access only to finite resources when describing a macroscopic system, like a measurement apparatus. Leveraging modern tools from equilibration of closed systems and typicality, we show how the measurement collapse can be seen as an effective description of a closed dynamics, of which we do not know all its details. Our model is then exploited to address the ``Wigner Friend Scenario'', and we observe that an agreement is reached when both Wigner and his friend acknowledge their finite resources perspective and describe the measurement process accordingly.",quant-ph,2024,human

In this paper, we first propose a second-order implicit difference scheme for TSFBTEs by employing the recently proposed L2-type formula [A.~A.~Alikhanov, C.~Huang, Appl.~Math.~Comput.~(2021) 126545]. Then, we prove the stability and the convergence of the proposed scheme. Based on such a numerical scheme, an L2-type all-at-once system is derived. In order to solve this system in a parallel-in-time pattern, a bilateral preconditioning technique is designed to accelerate the convergence of Krylov subspace solvers according to the special structure of the coefficient matrix of the system. We theoretically show that the condition number of the preconditioned matrix is uniformly bounded by a constant for the time fractional order $α\in (0,0.3624)$.

Compared to the conventional method, we achieve in-situ alignment of the collimators in a simplified two-step process. Besides, through a comparison of the spectra from the output ports of the laser, we assess their quality and establish the spectral evolution relationships among these ports. It is found that, in addition to the widely believed large nonlinear effects, spectral interference also plays a significant role in spectral distortion. Moreover, a transition between different stability states is observed from the power variation of the single pulse.","physics.optics,nlin.PS",2024,human

We find that the generation efficiency increases as the laser polarization is changed from linear to elliptical, and it becomes maximum for circular polarization. With the aid of a microscopic theory and a detailed analysis of the measured spectra, we reveal that such anomalous enhancement encodes the characteristic topology of the band structure that originates from the interplay of strong spin-orbit coupling and time-reversal symmetry protection.

In a novel approach, the high photoluminescence quantum yield organic crystal 2,2dash-((1E,1Edash)-hydrazine-1,2-diylidenebis(methaneylylidene))diphenol (SAA) is used as an optical waveguide medium for real-time data communication in the visible range, employing a microcontroller unit with on off keying modulation. Leveraging its spectral properties, the SAA crystal demonstrates dual active and passive waveguiding capabilities for signal modulation. Error-free signal detection is achieved thanks to the smooth, defect-free surface morphology of the crystal. The relationship between incident angle and light intensity reveals stable fluorescence under narrow angle excitation, positioning the crystal as an all-angle signal receiver that surpasses conventional optical fibers. A real time data transfer setup is demonstrated, enabling direct transmission from a serial interface and accurate reconstruction of grayscale images. This represents the first implementation of a fully organic crystal-based VLC platform, integrating wavelength conversion, omnidirectional waveguiding, and real time signal processing.

These five states were obtained in a 78-MHz configuration at different intracavity group delay dispersion (GDD) values ranging from anomalous (-0.035 ps$^2$) to normal (+0.015 ps$^2$). We put a particular focus on the characterization of the intensity noise as well as the free-running linewidth of the carrier-envelope-offset (CEO) frequency as a function of the different operation regimes. We observe that operation points far from the spontaneous emission peak of Yb (~1030 nm) and close to zero intracavity dispersion can be found, where the influence of pump noise is strongly suppressed. For such an operation point, we show that a CEO linewidth of less than 10-kHz at 1 s integration can be obtained without any active stabilization.",physics.optics,2020,human

For flat plasma mirror case, the colliding pulse radius is far larger than the radius of accelerated electron beam, which leads to smaller laser utilization efficiency. The concave plasma mirror can efficiently focus reflected laser to match electron beam radius. But the produced photon beam collimation is worse due to intensive transverse field and larger transverse wave vector of colliding laser. Here, we propose a new mechanism to achieve Compton scattering via employing convex plasma mirror. The convex plasma mirror improves reflected laser longitudinal length in addition to focusing effect, which ensures longer colliding time and larger laser utilization efficiency. Importantly, it leads transverse wave vector of colliding laser to be smaller, which guarantees better photon bunch collimation.",physics.plasm-ph,2022,human

Existing restoration methods are typically task-specific and often require prior knowledge of the degradation type, limiting their robustness in real-world clinical use. We propose EndoIR, an all-in-one, degradation-agnostic diffusion-based framework that restores multiple degradation types using a single model. EndoIR introduces a Dual-Domain Prompter that extracts joint spatial-frequency features, coupled with an adaptive embedding that encodes both shared and task-specific cues as conditioning for denoising. To mitigate feature confusion in conventional concatenation-based conditioning, we design a Dual-Stream Diffusion architecture that processes clean and degraded inputs separately, with a Rectified Fusion Block integrating them in a structured, degradation-aware manner. Furthermore, Noise-Aware Routing Block improves efficiency by dynamically selecting only noise-relevant features during denoising. Experiments on SegSTRONG-C and CEC datasets demonstrate that EndoIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple degradation scenarios while using fewer parameters than strong baselines, and downstream segmentation experiments confirm its clinical utility.","eess.IV,cs.AI,cs.CV,cs.RO",2025,human

Using a probabilistic signal-to-noise ratio analysis, taking into account all feedback correlations, which are strongly dependent upon these architectures the evolution of the distribution of the local field is found. This leads to a recursive scheme determining the complete time evolution of the order parameters of the network. Arbitrary Q and mainly zero temperature are considered. For the asymmetrically diluted and the layered feedforward network a closed-form solution is obtained while for the symmetrically diluted and fully connected architecture the feedback correlations prevent such a closed-form solution.

The result is a continuous function of the deformation parameter (eccentricity) through all bifurcation points of the short diameter orbit and its repetitions, and possesses the correct limit of the circular billiard at zero eccentricity. Away from the circular limit and the bifurcations, it reduces to the usual (extended) Gutzwiller trace formula which for the leading-order families of periodic orbits is identical to the result of Berry and Tabor. We show that the circular disk limit of the diameter-orbit contribution is also reached through contributions from closed (periodic and non-periodic) orbits of hyperbolic type with an even number of reflections from the boundary. We obtain the Maslov indices depending on deformation and energy in terms of the phases of the complex error and Airy functions. We find enhancement of the amplitudes near the common bifurcation points of both short-diameter and hyperbolic orbits.

We present the results of preliminary studies on the use of images created by muons as optical throughput calibrators of the single mirror small size telescope prototype SST-1M proposed for the Cherenkov Telescope Array.",astro-ph.IM,2015,human

The reflectance of the structure can be manipulated by altering the phase of GST by employing optical stimuli. The paper shows details on the optical and opto-thermal modeling techniques of GST. Numerical investigation reveals that the metastructure exhibits a conspicuous changeover from $\sim$ 99% absorption to very poor interaction with the operating light depending on the switching states of the GST, ending up with 85\% modulation depth and only 0.58 dB insertion loss. Due to noticeable differences in optical responses, we can demonstrate a high extinction ratio of 28 dB and a commendable FOM of 49, so far the best modulation performance in this wavelength window. In addition, real-time tracking of the reflectance during phase transition manifests high-speed switching expending low energy per cycle, on the order of sub-nJ. Hence, given its overall performance, the device will be a paradigm for the optical modulators for upcoming 2 $μ$m communication technology.","physics.optics,physics.app-ph",2022,human

Segmenting the left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV), and LV myocardium (MYO) in CMR images is crucial but time-consuming. Deep learning-based segmentation methods have emerged as effective tools for automating this process. However, CMR images present additional challenges due to irregular and varying heart shapes, particularly in basal and apical slices. In this study, we propose a classifier-guided two-stage network with an all-slice fusion transformer to enhance CMR segmentation accuracy, particularly in basal and apical slices.

At the frequency of best strain sensitivity, near 100 Hz, we set 90% confidence upper limits of $1.8 \times 10^{-25}$. At the low end of our frequency range, 20 Hz, we achieve upper limits of $3.9 \times 10^{-24}$. At 55 Hz we can exclude sources with ellipticities greater than $10^{-5}$ within 100 pc of Earth with fiducial value of the principal moment of inertia of $10^{38} \textrm{kg m}^2$.",gr-qc,2017,human

Manual annotation is time-consuming and error-prone, whereas automated approaches often struggle with low contrast and anatomical complexity. This paper introduces CephRes-MHNet, a multi-head residual convolutional network for robust and efficient cephalometric landmark detection. The architecture integrates residual encoding, dual-attention mechanisms, and multi-head decoders to enhance contextual reasoning and anatomical precision. Trained on the Aariz Cephalometric dataset of 1,000 radiographs, CephRes-MHNet achieved a mean radial error (MRE) of 1.23 mm and a success detection rate (SDR) @ 2.0 mm of 85.5%, outperforming all evaluated models. In particular, it exceeded the strongest baseline, the attention-driven AFPF-Net (MRE = 1.25 mm, SDR @ 2.0 mm = 84.1%), while using less than 25% of its parameters. These results demonstrate that CephRes-MHNet attains state-of-the-art accuracy through architectural efficiency, providing a practical solution for real-world orthodontic analysis.",cs.CV,2025,human

Gauge interactions in terms of physical gauge bosons are canonical with respect to massless gauge bosons as required by the exact gauge symmetry, but not so with respect to massive ones; and furthermore they are generally asymmetric in the two sets of gauge bosons. On noncommutative spacetime this already occurs for the simplest model of U(1) x U(1). We examine whether the above feature in gauge interactions can be perturbatively maintained in this model.

The proposed technique gives the first order approximation of the gain mismatches and sample-time mismatches, and employs first order approximation FIR filter banks to calibrate the sampled signal, which do not need large number of FIR taps. In the case of a two-channel 12-bit TIADC, the proposed technique improves SINAD of simulated data from 45dB to 69dB, and improves SINAD of measured data from 47dB to 53dB, while the number of FIR taps is only 30. In the case of slight mismatches, 24-bit FIR coefficient is sufficient to correct 12-bit signals, which makes it easy to implement this technique in hardware.

Stimuli were preprocessed with center-surround receptive fields and then fed to a layer of spiking neurons whose synaptic weights were updated using spike-timing-dependent-plasticity (STDP). We investigate how the quality of the represented objects changes under different WTA-I schemes and demonstrate that a network of 150 spiking neurons can efficiently represent objects with as little as 40 spikes.

A common method of separating the CMB from these foregrounds is via pixel-based parametric-model fitting. There are not currently enough all-sky maps to fit anything more than the most simple models of the sky.

It is shown that the inclusion of the CBASS data will significantly reduce the uncertainties in a number of key parameters in the modelling of both the galactic foregrounds and the CMB. The extra data allow estimates of the synchrotron spectral index to be constrained much more strongly than is presently possible, with corresponding improvements in the accuracy of the recovery of the CMB amplitude.

This construction makes sense for all simple algebraic groups, so we obtain a generalization of the Jones-Ocneanu trace to Hecke algebras of other types. We give a geometric expansion of this trace in terms of the irreducible characters of the Hecke algebra, and conclude that it agrees with a trace defined independently by Gomi.   Based on our proof, we also prove that certain simple perverse sheaves on a reductive algebraic group G are equivariantly formal for the conjugation action of a Borel B, or equivalently, that the Hochschild homology of any Soergel bimodule is free, as the authors had previously conjectured.   This construction is closely tied to knot homology. This interpretation of the Jones-Ocneanu trace is a more elementary manifestation of the geometric construction of HOMFLYPT homology given by the authors in a previous paper.","math.AG,math.QA,math.RT",2009,human

In order to make the library portable while maintaining good performance, intrinsic functions of vector extensions are abstracted by inline functions or preprocessor macros. We implemented the functions so that they can use sub-features of vector extensions such as fused multiply-add, mask registers and extraction of mantissa. In order to make computation with SIMD instructions efficient, the library only uses a small number of conditional branches, and all the computation paths are vectorized. We devised a variation of the Payne-Hanek argument reduction for trigonometric functions and a floating point remainder, both of which are suitable for vector computation.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0915v1,Radiation from matter entrainment in astrophysical jets: the AGN case,"Jets are found in a variety of astrophysical sources, from young stellar objects to active galactic nuclei. In all the cases the jet propagates with a supersonic velocity through the external medium, which can be inhomogeneous, and inhomogeneities could penetrate into the jet. The interaction of the jet material with an obstacle produces a bow shock in the jet in which particles can be accelerated up to relativistic energies and emit high-energy photons. In this work, we explore the active galactic nuclei scenario, focusing on the dynamical and radiative consequences of the interaction at different jet heights. We find that the produced high-energy emission could be detectable by the current gamma-ray telescopes. In general, the jet-clump interactions are a possible mechanism to produce (steady or flaring) high-energy emission in many astrophysical sources in which jets are present.",astro-ph.HE,2010,human

Of these, only two are associated with known globular clusters (NGC 1261 and Arp2). The remainder are candidate `orphan' streams, consistent with the idea that globular cluster streams are most visible close to dissolution. Our detections are likely a lower bound on the total number of dissolving globulars in the inner galaxy, since many globulars have few RRLS while only the brightest streams are visible over the Galactic RRLS background, particularly given the current lack of kinematical information.

The central idea is the formation of a tree consisting of positive odd numbers with number 1 as root. Functions for generating the tree from the root are presented and paths from nodes to the root are given by modified Collatz sequences (with the even numbers omitted). The Collatz problem is thus reduced to showing that all positive odd numbers are present in the tree. The main result is the proof of the boundedness of Collatz sequences. With the even numbers omitted they either end up in the number 1 (convergence) or in a repetitive cycle of numbers (divergence). The existence/non-existence of cycles in Collatz sequences (with the even numbers omitted) is still an open question.,math.NT,2014,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20255v2,Escaping AB caging via Floquet engineering: photo-induced long-range interference in an all-band-flat model,"Flat-band lattices hosting compact localized states are highly sensitive to external modulation, and the tailored design of a perturbation to imprint specific features becomes relevant. Here we show that periodic driving in the high-frequency regime transforms the all-flat-band diamond chain into one featuring two tunable quasi-flat bands and a residual flat band pinned at $E=0$. The interplay between lattice geometry and the symmetries of the driven system gives rise to drive-induced tunneling processes that redefine the interference conditions and open a controllable route to escaping Aharonov-Bohm caging. Under driving, the diamond chain effectively acquires the geometry of a dimerized lattice, exhibiting charge oscillations between opposite boundaries. This feature can be exploited to generate two-particle entanglement that is directly accessible experimentally. The resulting drive-engineered quasi-flat bands thus provide a versatile platform for manipulating quantum correlations, revealing a direct link between spectral fine structure and dynamical entanglement.","cond-mat.mes-hall,quant-ph",2025,human

The system records a 2D spatial intensity pattern, from which the pulse shape (amplitude and phase) are recovered, through a fast Deep Learning algorithm. We explore this scheme in simulations and demonstrate the recovery of ultrashort pulses, robustness to noise in measurements and to inaccuracies in the parameters of the system components. Our technique mitigates the need for commonly used iterative optimization reconstruction methods, which are usually slow and hampered by the presence of noise.

We construct the permutations with the minimum nonzero entangling power for every dimension. With the use of orthogonal latin squares, we construct the permutations with the maximum entangling power for every dimension.

The pressure dependence is non-monotonic, with a pressure-induced decrease of viscosity by more than 50 % at low temperature. Combining our data with literature data on the self-diffusion coefficient $D_\mathrm{s}$ of water, we check the Stokes-Einstein relation which, based on hydrodynamics, predicts constancy of $D_\mathrm{s} η/T$, where $T$ is the temperature. The observed temperature and pressure dependence of $D_\mathrm{s} η/T$ is analogous to that obtained in simulations of a realistic water model.

Wave-particle duality arises because the wave functions alone have both wave-like and particle-like properties.

This two-stage strategy is used to select and follow the dynamics of seven different unrelated conformations of HP36. In a notable case the MD trajectory rapidly evolves towards the folded state, yielding a typical RMS deviation of the core region of only 2.4 A from the closest NMR model (the typical RMSD over the whole structure being 4.0A). The analysis of the various MC-MD trajectories provides valuable insight into the details of the folding and mis-folding mechanisms and particularly about the delicate influence of local and non-local interactions in steering the folding process.","cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.stat-mech,q-bio.BM",2004,human

We evaluate different types of sequence-based methods for each task including traditional feature engineering approaches, different sequence encoding methods as well as large-scale pre-trained protein language models. In addition, we also investigate the performance of these methods under the multi-task learning setting. Experimental results show that large-scale pre-trained protein language models achieve the best performance for most individual tasks, and jointly training multiple tasks further boosts the performance.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11433v1,Prebiotic Vitamin B$_3$ Synthesis in Carbonaceous Planetesimals,"Aqueous chemistry within carbonaceous planetesimals is promising for synthesizing prebiotic organic matter essential to all life. Meteorites derived from these planetesimals delivered these life building blocks to the early Earth, potentially facilitating the origins of life. Here, we studied the formation of vitamin B$_3$ as it is an important precursor of the coenzyme NAD(P)(H), which is essential for the metabolism of all life as we know it. We propose a new reaction mechanism based on known experiments in the literature that explains the synthesis of vitamin B$_3$. It combines the sugar precursors glyceraldehyde or dihydroxyacetone with the amino acids aspartic acid or asparagine in aqueous solution without oxygen or other oxidizing agents. We performed thermochemical equilibrium calculations to test the thermodynamic favorability. The predicted vitamin B$_3$ abundances resulting from this new pathway were compared with measured values in asteroids and meteorites. We conclude that competition for reactants and decomposition by hydrolysis are necessary to explain the prebiotic content of meteorites. In sum, our model fits well into the complex network of chemical pathways active in this environment.","astro-ph.EP,physics.chem-ph",2023,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03726v2,An overlooked source of uncertainty in the mass of the Milky Way,"In the conventional approach to decomposing a rotation curve into a set of contributions from mass model components, the measurements of the rotation curve at different radii are taken to be independent. It is clear, however, that radial correlations are present in such data, for instance (but not only) because the orbital speed depends on the mass distribution at all (or, minimally, inner) radii. We adopt a very simple parametric form for a covariance matrix and constrain its parameters using Gaussian process regression. Applied to the rotation curve of the Milky Way, this suggests the presence of correlations between neighbouring rotation curve points with amplitudes $<10\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ over length scales of $1.5$-$2.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$ regardless of the assumed dark halo component. We show that accounting for such covariance can result in a $\sim 50$ per cent lower total mass estimate for the Milky Way than when it is neglected, and that the statistical uncertainty associated with the covariance is comparable to or exceeds the total systematic uncertainty budget. Our findings motivate including more detailed treatment of rotation curve covariance in future analyses.",astro-ph.GA,2024,human

It follows that strongly fillable planar contact structures are also Stein fillable, and all strong fillings of the 3-torus are equivalent up to symplectic deformation and blowup. These constructions result from a compactness theorem for punctured J-holomorphic curves that foliate a convex symplectic manifold. We use it also to show that the compactly supported symplectomorphism group on the cotangent bundle of the 2-torus is contractible, and to define an obstruction to strong fillability that yields a non-gauge-theoretic proof of Gay's recent nonfillability result for contact manifolds with positive Giroux torsion.","math.SG,math.AP",2008,human

Devices based on this all-optical switching (AOS) mechanism are competitive candidates for ultrafast memory applications. However, a large portion of the light energy is lost by reflection from the metal thin film as well as transmission to the substrate. In this paper, we explore the use of dielectric coatings to increase the light absorption by the magnetic metal layer based on the principle of constructive interference. We experimentally show that the switching energy oscillates with the dielectric layer thickness following the light interference profile as obtained from theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the switching threshold fluence can be reduced by at least $80\%$ to 0.6 mJ/cm$^2$ using two dielectric SiO$_2$ layers sandwiching the metal stack, which scales to 15 fJ of incident energy for a cell size of $50^2$ nm$^2$.","physics.app-ph,cond-mat.mes-hall,physics.optics",2021,human

We used the framework to formulate a survival model for using medical claims to predict hospital readmission and death that focuses on discharge placement, adjusting for confounding in estimating causal local average treatment effects. We trained the model on a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2008 and 2011, based on their 2009--2011 inpatient episodes, and then tested the model on 2012 episodes. The model scored an AUROC of approximately 0.76 on predicting all-cause readmissions -- defined using official Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) methodology -- or death within 30-days of discharge, being competitive against XGBoost and a Bayesian deep neural network, demonstrating that one need-not sacrifice interpretability for accuracy. Crucially, as a regression model, we provide what blackboxes cannot -- the exact gold-standard global interpretation of the model, identifying relative risk factors and quantifying the effect of discharge placement.

We use simple simulations to demonstrate the observational signatures of overfitting on ordered sequences of modelling residuals, via the autocorrelation and power spectral density. These results motivate the conclusion that, as commonly applied, the least squares method assumes too much when it assumes that residuals are uncorrelated for all possible models or values of the model parameters. We relax these too-stringent assumptions in favour of imposing an entropy prior on the (unknown, model-dependent, but potentially marginalizable) distribution function for residuals. We recommend a simple extension to the Mean Squared Error loss function that approximately incorporates this prior and can be used immediately for modelling applications where meaningfully-ordered sequences of observations or training data can be defined.","stat.ME,math.ST",2019,human

These limits are taken along any geodesic of $g$, yield simpler metrics of Lorentzian signature, and are isometric invariants. We show that they generalize Penrose's limit to the semi-Riemannian regime and, in certain cases, encode $g$'s tensorial geometry and its geodesic deviation. As an application of the latter, we partially extend a well known result by Hawking & Penrose to the semi-Riemannian regime: On any semi-Riemannian manifold, if the Ricci curvature is nonnegative along any complete geodesic without conjugate points that is ""causally independent"" (in a sense we make precise), then the curvature tensor along that geodesic must vanish in all normal directions.

In the framework of an all-electron implementation of many-body perturbation theory into the exciting code, we investigate three different absorption edges of three materials, spanning a broad energy window, with transition energies between a few hundred to thousands of eV. Specifically, we consider excitations from the Ti $K$ edge in rutile and anatase $\textrm{TiO}_2$, from the Pb $M_4$ edge in $\textrm{PbI}_2$, and from the Ca $L_{2,3}$ edge in $\textrm{CaO}$. We show that the electron-hole attraction rules x-ray absorption for deep core states, when local fields play a minor role. On the other hand, the local-field effects introduced by the exchange interaction between the excited electron and the hole dominate excitation processes from shallower core levels, separated by a spin-orbit splitting of a few eV. Our approach yields absorption spectra in good agreement with available experimental data, and allows for an in-depth analysis of the results, revealing the electronic contributions to the excitations, as well as their spatial distribution.",cond-mat.mtrl-sci,2016,human

Moreover, the longer time baseline afforded by ASAS suggests that Boyajian's Star has also undergone two brightening episodes in the past 11 years, rather than only exhibiting a monotonic decline. We analyze a sample of ~1000 comparison stars of similar brightness located in the same ASAS-SN field and demonstrate that the recent fading is significant at >99.4% confidence. The 2015-2017 dimming rate is consistent with that measured with Kepler data for the time period from 2009 to 2013.

In the VLA observations carried out in March and April of 1998, two new candidate lensed systems were discovered: CLASS B1152+199 and B1359+154. B1152+199 is a 1.6 arcsecond double, with a background quasar at z=1.019 lensed by a foreground galaxy at z=0.439. The relatively flat radio spectra of the lensed images, combined with a previous ROSAT detection of the source, make B1152+199 a strong candidate for time delay studies at both radio and X-ray wavelengths. B1359+154 is a quadruply lensed quasar at z=3.235, with a maximum image separation of 1.7 arcseconds. As yet, the redshift of the lensing object in this system is undetermined. The steep spectral index of the source suggests that B1359+154 will not exhibit strong variability, and is therefore unlikely to be useful for determining the Hubble constant from measured time delays.",astro-ph,1999,human

In a normal SPH simulation of the collapse and fragmentation of a molecular cloud, high-density regions of gas that form protostars are represented by many particles with small separations. These high-density regions require small time steps, limiting the time for which the simulation can be followed. Thus, the end result of the fragmentation can never be definitively ascertained, and comparisons between cloud fragmentation calculations and the observed characteristics of stellar systems cannot be made. In this paper, each high-density region is replaced by a single, non-gaseous particle, with appropriate boundary conditions, which contains all the mass in the region and accretes any infalling mass.

This result subsumes all known facts about Bishop discs around order-two, non-parabolic CR singularities.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05048v3,Loop-tree duality from vertices and edges,"The causal representation of multi-loop scattering amplitudes, obtained from the application of the loop-tree duality formalism, comprehensively elucidates, at integrand level, the behaviour of only physical singularities. This representation is found to manifest compact expressions for multi-loop topologies that have the same number of \textit{vertices}. Interestingly, integrands considered in former studies, with up-to six vertices and $L$ internal lines, display the same structure of up-to four-loop ones. The former is an insight that there should be a correspondence between vertices and the collection of internal lines, \textit{edges}, that characterise a multi-loop topology. By virtue of this relation, in this paper, we embrace an approach to properly classify multi-loop topologies according to vertices and edges. Differently from former studies, we consider the most general topologies, by connecting vertices and edges in all possible ways. Likewise, we provide a procedure to generate causal representation of multi-loop topologies by considering the structure of causal propagators. Explicit causal representations of loop topologies with up-to nine vertices are provided.","hep-ph,hep-th",2021,human

It is more fundamental than the relationship between any two of the parameters, and can reduce the residual of the Tully--Fisher $L$--$V$ relations by about 50\%. Noticed that the power index of $V$ is doubled from that of $R$, which implies that the total mass and the mass distribution of galaxies plays an important role in forming the fundamental plane. Involving the third parameter of galactic size has a strong physical implication on galaxy formation and the dark--mass distribution.",astro-ph,2001,human

From the analysis of these data, shower observables such as the arrival direction, the core position at ground, the age and the primary energy are estimated, from which the energy spectrum of cosmic rays and its composition can be studied. In this work, we will describe the methodologies of HAWC cosmic ray analyses, including the Bayesian spectral unfolding procedure used to determine the all-particle and the light component energy spectra of cosmic rays. We will see that the distribution of the shower age vs the fraction of hit PMT's contains information about the composition of cosmic rays.",astro-ph.HE,2018,human

The technique addresses a critical bottleneck in ASI image data reliability and usability for real time space weather via automated geo-referencing under real-world field conditions. The system corrects the lens distortion in ASIs using a well-established fisheye lens model and automatically estimates camera orientation in terms of roll, pitch, and yaw angles relative to True North and the horizontal plane perpendicular to the zenith using star tracking. Unlike traditional methods that require manual intervention and periodic recalibration, Auto-Cal performs nightly unattended recalibrations using observed stellar motion, adapting to mechanical shifts or environmental changes. Each calibration step includes formal error estimates, allowing end users to assess the confidence of geo-located data in real-time. This capability enables dependable ASI operations in remote or unmanned settings and supports higher-fidelity integration with other geophysical instruments. Auto-Cal provides a scalable foundation for maintaining a large array of ASIs, thus enabling long-term atmospheric monitoring and real-time space weather alerts.","physics.space-ph,astro-ph.IM",2025,human

Recently, Ito et al. proposed a quantum attack on Feistel-2* structure (Ito et al.'s attack) based onthe Q2 model. However, it is not realistic since the quantum oracle needs to be accessed by the adversary, and the data complexityis high. To solve this problem, a quantum all-subkeys-recovery (ASR) attack based on multi-equations quantum claw-finding is proposed, which takes a more realistic model, the Q1 model, as the scenario, and only requires 3 plain-ciphertext pairs to quickly crack the 6-round Feistel-2* structure. First, we proposed a multi-equations quantum claw-finding algorithm to solve the claw problem of finding multiple equations. In addition, Grover's algorithm is used to speedup the rest subkeys recovery.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20137v3,ePC: Overcoming Exponential Signal Decay in Deep Predictive Coding Networks,"Predictive Coding (PC) offers a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation for neural network training, yet struggles with deeper architectures. This paper identifies the root cause and provides a principled solution. We uncover that the canonical state-based formulation of PC (sPC) is, by design, deeply inefficient on digital hardware, due to an inherent signal decay problem that scales exponentially with depth. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel reparameterization of PC, named error-based PC (ePC), which does not suffer from signal decay. By optimizing over prediction errors rather than states, ePC enables signals to reach all layers simultaneously and unattenuated, converging orders of magnitude faster than sPC. Experiments across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate that ePC matches backpropagation's performance even for deeper models where sPC struggles. Besides practical improvements, our work provides theoretical insight into PC dynamics and establishes a foundation for scaling bio-inspired learning to deeper architectures on digital hardware and beyond.","cs.LG,cs.AI",2025,human

Constant-depth circuits are well suited for implementation on a noisy hardware since it may be possible to execute the entire circuit within the qubit coherence time. Thus our results could facilitate an experimental study of exotic phases of matter with a non-abelian particle statistics. We also show that adaptiveness is essential for our circuit construction. Namely, task (b) cannot be realized by non-adaptive constant-depth local circuits for any non-abelian group $G$.

Properties of parity-time-symmetric complex potentials have been heavily studied before. In this article, new classes of non-parity-time-symmetric complex potentials featuring conjugate-pair eigenvalue symmetry in its spectrum are constructed by operator symmetry methods. Due to this eigenvalue symmetry, it is shown that the spectrum of these complex potentials is often all-real. Under parameter tuning in these potentials, phase transition can also occur, where pairs of complex eigenvalues appear in the spectrum. A peculiar feature of the phase transition here is that, the complex eigenvalues may bifurcate out from an interior continuous eigenvalue inside the continuous spectrum, in which case a phase transition takes place without going through an exceptional point. In one spatial dimension, this class of non-parity-time-symmetric complex potentials is of the form $V(x)=h'(x)-h^2(x)$, where $h(x)$ is an arbitrary parity-time-symmetric complex function.

We interpret these upper limits as both an ""exclusion region"" in the boson mass/black hole mass plane and the maximum detectable distance for a given boson mass, based on an assumption of the age of the black hole/boson cloud system.",astro-ph.HE,2021,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03005v1,Combined Analysis of Cosmic-Ray Anisotropy with IceCube and HAWC,"During the past two decades, experiments in both the northern and southern hemispheres have observed a small but measurable energy-dependent sidereal anisotropy in the arrival direction distribution of Galactic cosmic rays with relative intensities at the level of one per mille. Individually, these measurements are restricted by limited sky coverage, and so the power spectrum of the anisotropy obtained from any one measurement displays a systematic correlation between different multipole modes $C_\ell$. We present the results of a joint analysis of the anisotropy on all angular scales using cosmic-ray data collected during 336 days of operation of the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory (located at 19$^\circ$ N) and 5 years of data taking from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (located at 90$^\circ$ S) The results include a combined sky map and an all-sky power spectrum in the overlapping energy range of the two experiments at around 10 TeV. We describe the methods used to combine the IceCube and HAWC data, address the individual detector systematics, and study the region of overlapping field of view between the two observatories.",astro-ph.HE,2017,human

It is found that the bottleneck for large scale applications is the computation of the response density matrix, which scales as $O(N^3)$. Here for the response properties with respect to the homogeneous electric field, we present an efficient parallel linear scaling algorithm for the response density matrix calculation. Our scheme is based on the second-order trace-correcting purification and the parallel sparse matrix-matrix multiplication algorithms. The new scheme reduces the formal scaling from $O(N^3)$ to $O(N)$, and shows good parallel scalability over tens of thousands of cores. As demonstrated by extensive validation, we achieve a rapid computation of accurate polarizabilities using DFPT. Finally, the computational efficiency of this scheme has been illustrated by making the scaling tests and scalability tests on massively parallel computer systems.",physics.comp-ph,2020,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2146v1,Probing General Relativity with Accreting Black Holes,"Most of the X-ray emission from luminous accreting black holes emerges from within 20 gravitational radii. The effective emission radius is several times smaller if the black hole is rapidly spinning. General Relativistic effects can then be very important. Large spacetime curvature causes strong lightbending and large gravitational redshifts. The hard X-ray, power-law-emitting corona irradiates the accretion disc generating an X-ray reflection component. Atomic features in the reflection spectrum allow gravitational redshifts to be measured. Time delays between observed variations in the power-law and the reflection spectrum (reverberation) enable the physical scale of the reflecting region to be determined. The relative strength of the reflection and power-law continuum depends on light bending. All of these observed effects enable the immediate environment of the black hole where the effects of General Relativity are on display to be probed and explored.","astro-ph.HE,gr-qc",2012,human

We show that reduced models are able to reproduce device functions (rectification and selectivity) for a wide variety of charge patterns; that is, reduced models are useful in understanding the mesoscale physics of the device (i.e., how the current is produced). We also analyze the relationship of the reduced implicit-water models with the explicit-water model and show that diffusion coefficients in the reduced models can be used as adjustable parameters with which the results of the explicit- and implicit-water models can be related. We find that the values of the diffusion coefficients are sensitive to the net charge of the pore, but are relatively transferable to different voltages and charge patterns with the same total charge.","cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.stat-mech",2019,human

ASVI has recently shown functional applications including reconfigurable magnonics and neuromorphic computing, where the introduction of vortex textures broadens functionality beyond conventional artificial spin ice which generally supports macrospin states. However, local control of writing vortex states in ASVI remains an open challenge. Here we demonstrate techniques for field-free magnetic vortex writing in ASVI. We expand ASVI to support metastable macrospin, single-vortex and double-vortex states. All-optical writing via focused laser illumination can locally write double-vortex textures, and surface-probe writing using an MFM tip can locally write single vortex states. We leverage this writing to tailor and explore the reconfigurable energy landscape of ASVI, demonstrating programmable local seeding of avalanche-like reversal events. The global field-free texture selective writing techniques reported here expand the suite of nanomagnetic control techniques, with a host of future applications including fundamental studies of avalanche dynamics, physical memory, and direct writing of nanomagnetic 'weights' in physical neuromorphic neural networks.","cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.mes-hall",2025,human

This ring contains all iterated integrals of modular forms that are constant on conjugacy classes. It possesses a natural mixed Hodge structure and, after tensoring with Q_ell$, a natural action of the absolute Galois group.

We confirm that the overall CO distribution shows a good spatial correspondence with the PAH emission, and their intensities exhibit a good power-law correlation with a spatial resolution down to 4$'$ over the region of 10$^\circ$$\times$10$^\circ$. We also reveal poorer correlation for small scale structures between the two quantities toward NGC 6357, due to strong UV radiation from local sources.

In order to study the effect of this transformation, its application to known perfect-fluid solutions is presented.

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns of proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2015. The analysis uses the invariant mass of the lepton pair, searching for a kinematic edge or a resonant-like excess compatible with the Z boson mass. Both search modes use several event categories in order to increase the sensitivity to new physics. These categories are based on the rapidity of the leptons, the multiplicity of jets and b jets, the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta, and missing transverse momentum.

Humans can perform shape completion of occluded objects by relying on past experience. Therefore, we propose a method that generates images of an object from various viewpoints using a single input RGB image. A deep neural network is trained to imagine the object appearance from many viewpoints. We present the whole pipeline, which takes a single RGB image as input and returns a sequence of RGB and depth images of the object. The method utilizes a CNN-based object detector to extract the object from the natural scene. Then, the proposed network generates a set of RGB and depth images.

These policies are based on the Least-Recently-Used replacement principle, and are, here, referred to as spatial multi-LRU. Based on these, cache inventories are updated in a way that provides content diversity to users who are covered by, and thus have access to, more than one station. Two variations are proposed, namely the multi-LRU-One and -All, which differ in the number of replicas inserted in the involved caches. By introducing spatial approximations, we propose a Che-like method to predict the hit probability, which gives very accurate results under the Independent Reference Model (IRM). It is shown that the performance of multi-LRU increases the more the multi-coverage areas increase, and it approaches the performance of other proposed centralised policies, when multi-coverage is sufficient. For IRM traffic multi-LRU-One outperforms multi-LRU-All, whereas when the traffic exhibits temporal locality the -All variation can perform better.","cs.PF,cs.NI",2016,human

In particular, we investigate its dependence on the spin-flip probability of Gd $a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$, a material parameter describing the strength of spin-phonon coupling. We do so to elucidate the mechanisms behind all-optical switching in systems where Co is coupled to heavy rare-earth elements with higher damping such as Tb. In alloys, our observations are twofold. First, an increase of $a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$ leads to a broadening of the range of compositions for which AOS is observed. Second, the ideal Co content is decreased as $a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$ is varied. For bilayers, our analysis indicates that switching is most efficient when $a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$ takes on small values. Conversely, increasing the value of $a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$ leads to a general suppression of AOS. Comparing alloys to bilayers, we find that AOS in alloys exhibits greater resilience to variations in $a_\mathrm{sf,Gd}$ than it does in bilayers.",cond-mat.mes-hall,2024,human

The adaptive capacity requires each of the signals to be measured by a separate apparatus, but allows the quantum states of these signals to be measured in stages, with the first stage partially reducing their quantum states, and where measurements in subsequent stages which further reduce the quantum states may depend on the results of a classical computation taking as input the outcomes of the first round of measurements.",quant-ph,2002,human

The results are interpreted in terms of several simplified models. These represent a broad range of production and decay scenarios for charginos and neutralinos. A parametric neural network is used to target several of the models with large backgrounds. In addition, results using orthogonal search regions are provided for all the models, simplifying alternative theoretical interpretations of the results. Depending on the model hypotheses, charginos and neutralinos with masses up to values between 300 and 1450 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level.",hep-ex,2021,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12012v1,DeepMET: Improving missing transverse momentum estimation with a deep neural network,"At hadron colliders, the net transverse momentum of particles that do not interact with the detector (missing transverse momentum, $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$) is a crucial observable in many analyses. In the standard model, $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ originates from neutrinos. Many beyond-the-standard-model particles, such as dark matter candidates, are also expected to leave the experimental apparatus undetected. This paper presents a novel $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ estimator, DeepMET, which is based on deep neural networks that were developed by the CMS Collaboration at the LHC. The DeepMET algorithm produces a weight for each reconstructed particle based on its properties. The estimator is based on the negative vector sum of the weighted transverse momenta of all reconstructed particles in an event. Compared with other estimators currently employed by CMS, DeepMET improves the $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ resolution by 10$-$30%, shows improvement for a wide range of final states, is easier to train, and is more resilient against the effects of additional proton-proton interactions accompanying the collision of interest.",hep-ex,2025,human

We show that it is possible to cancel all the scalar one-loop quadratic divergences and hence obtain a viable solution for the fine-tuning problem, while satisfying the electroweak precision observables, including the $ρ$ parameter, and successfully generating the neutrino masses.

SDSS J1205+3422, J1638+2827, and J2228+2201 show interesting behaviour in their observed optical light curves, and subsequent spectroscopy shows significant changes in the C IV broad emission line, with both line collapse and emergence being displayed on rest-frame timescales of $\sim$240-1640 days. These are rapid changes, especially when considering virial black hole mass estimates of $M_{\rm BH} > 10^{9} M_{\odot}$ for all three quasars. Continuum and emission line measurements from the three quasars show changes in the continuum-equivalent width plane with the CLQs seen to be on the edge of the full population distribution, and showing indications of an intrinsic Baldwin effect.

Additionally, we make a direct detection of material evaporating from the radiation-pressure-dominated inner disk. Our X-ray data thus reveal the black hole as it ejects a portion of the inner accretion flow and then drives a wind from the outer disk, all in a bizarre cycle that lasts fewer than 60 seconds but can repeat for weeks.

The effect of fiber asymmetry was studied experimentally by selective excitation and monitoring of individual fiber cores at different wavelengths between 1500 nm and 1800 nm. Higher energy transfer rate to non-excited core was observed in the case of fast core excitation due to nonlinear asymmetry balancing of temporal solitons, which was confirmed by the dedicated numerical simulations based on the coupled generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equations. Moreover, the simulation results correspond qualitatively with the experimentally acquired dependences of the output dual-core extinction ratio on excitation energy and wavelength. In the case of 1800 nm fast core excitation, narrow band spectral intensity switching between the output channels was registered with contrast of 23 dB. The switching was achieved by the change of the excitation pulse energy in sub-nanojoule region.

To confront this challenge, we present a user-ready EMRI waveform model for generic (eccentric and inclined) orbits in Kerr spacetime, using an analytical self-force approach. Our model accurately covers all EMRIs with arbitrary inclination and black hole spin, up to modest eccentricity ($\lesssim 0.3$) and separation ($\gtrsim2$--$10M$ from the last stable orbit). In that regime, our waveforms are accurate at the leading `adiabatic' order, and they approximately capture transient self-force resonances that significantly impact the gravitational-wave phase. The model fills an urgent need for extensive waveforms in ongoing data-analysis studies, and its individual components will continue to be useful in future science-adequate waveforms.","gr-qc,astro-ph.HE",2021,human

Recent works have proposed to estimate the length of memory in a temporal network by using high-order Markov models. Here we show that network memory is inherently multidimensional and cannot be meaningfully reduced to a single scalar quantity. Accordingly, we introduce a mathematical framework for defining and efficiently estimating the microscopic shape of memory, which fully characterises how the activity of each link intertwines with the activities of all other links. We validate our methodology on a wide range of synthetic models of temporal networks with tuneable memory, and subsequently study the heterogeneous shapes of memory emerging in various real-world networks.",physics.soc-ph,2020,human

It was found a special finite set of functional parameters, defined as the monodromy data for the fundamental solution of associated spectral problem. Similarly to the scattering data in the inverse scattering transform, these monodromy data can be used for characterization of any local solution of the field equations. A ""direct"" and ""inverse"" problems of such monodromy transform admit unambiguous solutions. For the linear singular integral equation with a scalar (i.e. non-matrix) kernel, which solves the inverse problem of this monodromy transform, an equivalent regularization -- a Fredholm linear integral equation of the second kind is constrcuted in several convenient forms. For arbitrary choice of the monodromy data a simple iterative method leads to an effective construction of the solution in terms of homogeneously convergent functional series.","gr-qc,hep-th,nlin.SI",1999,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15825v1,Regular distribution of star formation regions along the spiral arms and rings of disk galaxies,"Last years studies have shown that the spatial regularity in the distribution of young stellar population along the spiral arms and rings of galaxies, previously considered to be rare, is a fairly common phenomenon. Spatial regularity has been found in the spiral arms and rings of galaxies of various morphology, from lenticular to extremely late-type spiral. The characteristic regularity scale is equal to 350-500 pc or a multiple thereof in all studied galaxies. Theoretical models predict a scale of instability of the stellar-gas disk on the order of a few kpc, which is several times larger than observed, although the most recent magneto-hydrodynamic simulations predict the formation of regular chains of star formation regions in spiral arms on a scale of 500-700 pc for the Milky Way-like galaxies. Modern high-quality surveys, such as PHANGS-MUSE, provide the necessary observational data (surface densities and velocity dispersions of gas and stellar population) to directly calculate the regularity scales in galaxies with high spatial resolution and wide field of view, which is a promising direction for research in this field.",astro-ph.GA,2024,human

M32 is not detected, but we give detailed measurements of the nucleus of M81. Our observations of M81 show a bright nuclear point source at N, and comparison to measurements made in the early 1970's gives an increase in nuclear flux of nearly a factor of two. If the comparison is accurate, the nuclear mid-IR emission must ultimately be powered by a variable, compact source, similar to that in Seyferts and quasars. M81 has been classified in the literature as a low-luminosity LINER, not a pure Seyfert galaxy. Further, it has been suggested that this and other low-luminosity AGN may have intrinsically different spectra than Seyferts and quasars. However, we find that the relative fluxes in the X-ray, MIR, and radio bands, all essentially unaffected by extinction and galaxy pollution, show a nuclear continuum remarkably like that of a bona fide Seyfert or quasar.",astro-ph,2001,human

This time dependent model reproduces the main features of the rapid multi-wavelength variability of XTEJ1118+480. A strong requirement of the model is that the total jet power should be at least a few times larger than the observed X-ray luminosity. This would be consistent with the overall low radiative efficiency of the source. We present independent arguments showing that the jet probably dominates the energetic output of all accreting black holes in the low-hard state.,astro-ph,2004,human

This is due to experimental progress at Neutrino Telescopes such as IceCube which have begun to gain sensitivity to the flux of neutrinos in this energy range. In view of this, a precise calculation of the scattering rate of neutrinos upon atoms is presented. The two main components of the calculation are the differential cross-section predictions for neutrino scattering upon an atomic nucleus (such as that which make up water), as well as upon atomic electrons. In the first case, the predictions for neutrino-nucleon cross-sections in charged- and neutral-current scattering are refined by including resonant contributions generated within the photon field of the nucleus, which alter the considered distributions by up to $\approx 4\%$. In the latter case, radiative corrections are provided for all $2\to2$ scattering processes of the form $\barν_e e^-\to f\bar{f}^{\prime}$. For antineutrino energies of $E_{\barν_e}\approx6{\rm~PeV}$, where these processes become resonantly enhanced (the Glashow resonance) and dominate the total cross-section, these corrections amount to $\approx-10\%$.","hep-ph,astro-ph.HE",2019,human

The average transverse kinetic energy is found to increase with multiplicity, at a faster rate for heavier strange particle species in all systems. At similar multiplicities, the difference in average transverse kinetic energy between different particle species is observed to be larger for pp and pPb events than for PbPb events. In pPb collisions, the average transverse kinetic energy is found to be slightly larger in the Pb-going direction than in the p-going direction for events with large multiplicity.

Leveraging a profile root-finding technique based on General Relativity we describe an ANN solver to directly tackle the system of ordinary differential equations. Through our extensive numerical analysis, we demonstrate, for the first time, that there is no self-similar critical solution for the parabolic class in the high dimensions of space-time. Specifically, we develop $95\%$ ANN-based confidence intervals for all the solutions in their domains. At the $95\%$ confidence level, our ANN estimators confirm that there is no black hole solution in higher dimensions, hence the gravitational collapse does not occur. Results provide some doubts about the universality of the Choptuik phenomena. Therefore, we conclude that the fastest-growing mode of the perturbations that determine the critical exponent does not exist for the parabolic class in the high dimensions.","gr-qc,hep-th,math-ph,physics.comp-ph,physics.data-an",2023,human

Previously, it was an open question whether this problem on sensors with arbitrary sensing ranges is solvable in polynomial time. We settle this open question positively by giving an $O(n^2 \log n)$ time algorithm. For the special case when all sensors have the same-size sensing range, the previously best solution takes $O(n^2)$ time. We present an $O(n \log n)$ time algorithm for this case; further, if all sensors are initially located on the coverage segment, our algorithm takes $O(n)$ time. Also, we extend our techniques to the cycle version of the problem where the barrier coverage is for a simple cycle and the sensors are allowed to move only along the cycle. For sensors with the same-size sensing range, we solve the cycle version in $O(n)$ time, improving the previously best $O(n^2)$ time solution.","cs.CG,cs.DS",2012,human

http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08440v1,BGPeek-a-Boo: Active BGP-based Traceback for Amplification DDoS Attacks,"Amplification DDoS attacks inherently rely on IP spoofing to steer attack traffic to the victim. At the same time, IP spoofing undermines prosecution, as the originating attack infrastructure remains hidden. Researchers have therefore proposed various mechanisms to trace back amplification attacks (or IP-spoofed attacks in general). However, existing traceback techniques require either the cooperation of external parties or a priori knowledge about the attacker. We propose BGPeek-a-Boo, a BGP-based approach to trace back amplification attacks to their origin network. BGPeek-a-Boo monitors amplification attacks with honeypots and uses BGP poisoning to temporarily shut down ingress traffic from selected Autonomous Systems. By systematically probing the entire AS space, we detect systems forwarding and originating spoofed traffic. We then show how a graph-based model of BGP route propagation can reduce the search space, resulting in a 5x median speed-up and over 20x for 1/4 of all cases. BGPeek-a-Boo achieves a unique traceback result 60% of the time in a simulation-based evaluation supported by real-world experiments.","cs.CR,cs.NI",2021,human

We also use inclusive e-A data to extract an empirical parameter $U_{FSI}( (\vec q_3+\vec k)^2)$ to account for the interaction of final state nucleons (FSI) with the optical potential of the nucleus. Similarly we use $V_{eff}$ to account for the Coulomb potential of the nucleus. With three parameters $ε$, $U_{FSI}( (\vec q_3+\vec k)^2)$ and $V_{eff}$ we can describe the energy of final state electrons for all available electron QE scattering data.

We evaluate OSTTP on two temporal tasks, showcasing competitive performance compared to BPTT.

For lead dissociation processes, which correspond to the pomeron-lead event topology, the EPOS-LHC generator predictions are a factor of two below the data, but the model gives a reasonable description of the rapidity gap spectrum shape. For the pomeron-proton topology, the EPOS-LHC, QGSJET II, and HIJING predictions are all at least a factor of five lower than the data.

The algorithm inputs information from all reconstructed particles in the vicinity of a $τ_\mathrm{h}$ candidate and employs a deep neural network with convolutional layers to efficiently process the inputs. This algorithm leads to a significantly improved performance compared with the previously used one. For example, the efficiency for a genuine $τ_\mathrm{h}$ to pass the discriminator against jets increases by 10-30% for a given efficiency for quark and gluon jets. Furthermore, a more efficient $τ_\mathrm{h}$ reconstruction is introduced that incorporates additional hadronic decay modes. The superior performance of the new algorithm to discriminate against jets, electrons, and muons and the improved $τ_\mathrm{h}$ reconstruction method are validated with LHC proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV.","hep-ex,physics.ins-det",2022,human

The results are obtained from the analysis of proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The measured inclusive fiducial cross section is 2.73 $\pm$ 0.26 fb, in agreement with the standard model expectation of 2.86 $\pm$ 0.1 fb. Differential cross sections are measured as a function of several kinematic observables sensitive to the Higgs boson production and decay to four leptons. A set of double-differential measurements is also performed, yielding a comprehensive characterization of the four leptons final state. Constraints on the Higgs boson trilinear coupling and on the bottom and charm quark coupling modifiers are derived from its transverse momentum distribution. All results are consistent with theoretical predictions from the standard model.",hep-ex,2023,human

The selection is optimized to minimize the number of background events, and relies on an efficient prompt lepton discrimination strategy.

All searches make use of proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV, which were recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$. Signatures with at least one photon and large missing transverse momentum are categorized into events with two isolated photons, events with a lepton and a photon, events with additional jets, and events with at least one high-energy photon. No excess of events is observed beyond expectations from standard model processes, and limits are set in the context of gauge-mediated SUSY. Compared to the individual searches, the combination extends the sensitivity to gauge-mediated SUSY in both electroweak and strong production scenarios by up to 100 GeV in neutralino and chargino masses, and yields the first CMS result combining various SUSY searches in events with photons at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV.",hep-ex,2019,human

The different-flavor dilepton (e$μ$) final state is analyzed, with dedicated categories targeting gluon fusion, electroweak vector boson fusion, and associated production with a W or Z boson. Kinematic information from associated jets is combined using matrix element techniques to increase the sensitivity to anomalous effects at the production vertex. A simultaneous measurement of four Higgs boson couplings to electroweak vector bosons is performed in the framework of a standard model effective field theory.

http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-lat/9604004v1,Massive Fermions in Lattice Gauge Theory,"This paper presents a formulation of lattice fermions applicable to all quark masses, large and small. We incorporate interactions from previous light-fermion and heavy-fermion methods, and thus ensure a smooth connection to these limiting cases. The couplings in improved actions are evaluated for arbitrary fermion mass~$m_q$, without expansions around small- or large-mass limits. We treat both the action and external currents. By interpreting on-shell improvement criteria through the lattice theory's Hamiltonian, one finds that cutoff artifacts factorize into the form $b_n(m_qa)[\vek{p}a]^{s_n}$, where $\vek{p}$ is a momentum characteristic of the system under study, $s_n$ is related to the dimension of the $n$th interaction, and $b_n(m_qa)$ is a bounded function, numerically always~$\order(1)$ or less. In heavy-quark systems $\vek{p}$ is typically rather smaller than the fermion mass~$m_q$. Therefore, artifacts of order $(m_qa)^s$ do not arise, even when $m_qa\gsim1$. An important by-product of our analysis is an interpretation of the Wilson and Sheikholeslami-Wohlert actions applied to nonrelativistic fermions.","hep-lat,hep-ph",1996,human

Our method guarantees probabilistic consistency, in the sense that the true states are bounded by sets (zonotopes) across all time steps, with high probability. We formally relate GP-ZKF with the corresponding stochastic approach, GP-EKF, in the case of learned (nonlinear) models. In particular, when linearization errors and aleatoric uncertainties are omitted and epistemic uncertainties are simplified, GP-ZKF reduces to GP-EKF. We empirically demonstrate our method's efficacy in both a simulated pendulum domain and a real-world robot-assisted dressing domain, where GP-ZKF produced more consistent and less conservative set-based estimates than all baseline stochastic methods.","eess.SY,cs.RO",2021,human

Cross-sections are presented as a function of jet multiplicity and of the transverse momentum of the leading b-jet for both the muon and electron decay modes of the W boson. The W+b-jets cross-section, corrected for all known detector effects, is quoted in a limited kinematic range, using jets reconstructed with the anti-k_t clustering algorithm with transverse momentum above 25 GeV and rapidity within +/- 2.1. Combining the muon and electron channels, the fiducial cross-section for W+b-jets is measured to be 7.1 +/- 0.5 (stat) +/- 1.4 (syst) pb, consistent with next-to-leading order QCD calculations within 1.5 standard deviations.",hep-ex,2013,human

The double ratio of measured yields of prompt charmonia reconstructed through their decays into muon pairs, (N[psi(2S)]/N[J/psi])[PbPb] / (N[psi(2S)]/N[J/psi])[pp], is determined as a function of PbPb collision centrality and charmonium transverse momentum pt, in two kinematic intervals: abs(y) < 1.6 covering 6.5 < pt < 30 GeV/c and 1.6 < abs(y) < 2.4 covering 3 < pt < 30 GeV/c. The centrality-integrated double ratios are 0.36 +/- 0.08 (stat) +/-0.05 (syst) in the first interval and 0.24 +/- 0.22 (stat) +/- 0.09 (syst) in the second.

Then we introduce two types of freeness for an affine hypersurface $X$, and prove various relations between them and the freeness of the projective hypersurface $D$. We write down a proof of the folklore result saying that an affine hypersurface is free if and only if all of its singularities are free, in the sense of K. Saito's definition in the local setting. In particular, smooth affine hypersurfaces and affine plane curves are always free.

For all systems, the extracted correlation radii steadily increase with the event multiplicity, and decrease with increasing $k_\mathrm{T}$. The radii are in the range 1-5 fm, the largest values corresponding to very high multiplicity pPb interactions and to peripheral PbPb collisions with multiplicities similar to those seen in pPb data.

We show that the optimal control is given by the stabilizing solution of an integral Riccati equation. If the input operator is not maximally unbounded, then this integral Riccati equation is equivalent to the algebraic Riccati equation.   Using the integral Riccati equation, we show that for (nonsingular) minimization problems the optimal state-feedback loop is always well-posed. In particular, the optimal state-feedback operator is admissible also for the original semigroup, not only for the closed-loop semigroup (as has been known in some cases); moreover, both settings are well-posed with respect to an external input. This leads to the positive solution of several central, previously open questions on exponential, output and dynamic (aka. ""internal"") stabilization and on coprime factorization of transfer functions.   Our theory covers all quadratic (possibly indefinite) cost functions, but the optimal state feedback need not be well-posed (admissible) unless the cost function is uniformly positive or the system is sufficiently regular.",math.OC,2016,human

The data were recorded with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. For events containing a leading isolated photon with $p_\mathrm{T}^γ>$ 40 GeV$/c$ and an associated jet with $p_\mathrm{T}^\text{jet} >$ 30 GeV$/c$, the photon+jet azimuthal correlation and $p_\mathrm{T}$ imbalance in PbPb collisions are studied as functions of collision centrality and $p_\mathrm{T}^γ$. The results are compared to pp reference data collected at the same collision energy and to predictions from several theoretical models for parton energy loss. No evidence of broadening of the photon+jet azimuthal correlations is observed, while the ratio $p_\mathrm{T}^\text{jet}/p_\mathrm{T}^γ$ decreases significantly for PbPb data relative to the pp reference. All models considered agree within uncertainties with the data. The number of associated jets per photon with $p_\mathrm{T}^γ>$ 80 GeV$/c$ is observed to be shifted towards lower $p_\mathrm{T}^\text{jet}$ values in central PbPb collisions compared to pp collisions.","nucl-ex,hep-ex",2017,human

The tracks found by the FTK are based on inputs from all modules of the pixel and silicon microstrip trackers. The as-built FTK system and components are described, as is the online software used to control them while running in the ATLAS data acquisition system. Also described is the simulation of the FTK hardware and the optimization of the AM pattern banks. An optimization for long-lived particles with large impact parameter values is included. A test of the FTK system with the data playback facility that allowed the FTK to be commissioned during the shutdown between Run 2 and Run 3 of the LHC is reported. The resulting tracks from part of the FTK system covering a limited $η$-$φ$ region of the detector are compared with the output from the FTK simulation.

After sample exposures of several hours at 100% relative humidity at room temperature (around 295 K), when the temperature was reduced, the resistance increased to the upper measurement limit of our apparatus (120 MΩ) at around 240 K. Upon warming, the resistance dropped back to the room temperature value, with some hysteresis. For sample exposures after several hours at 100% relative humidity at room temperature, as the relative humidity was reduced, the sample resistance increased to the upper range limit of the apparatus. As the relative humidity was then increased (all at room temperature), the resistance dropped. For samples exposed to low (~10%) relative humidity for several hours at room temperature, as the humidity was increased (at room temperature), the resistance decreased, and then increased when the humidity was reduced.

In a first part, we generalize the Hausdorff dimension by defining a family of bi-Lipschitz invariants, called critical parameters, that measure largeness for infinite-dimensional metric spaces. Basic properties of these invariants are given, and they are estimated for a naturel set of spaces generalizing the usual Hilbert cube. In a second part, we estimate the value of these new invariants in the case of some Wasserstein spaces, as well as the dynamical complexity of push-forward maps. The lower bounds rely on several embedding results; for example we provide bi-Lipschitz embeddings of all powers of any space inside its Wasserstein space, with uniform bound and we prove that the Wasserstein space of a d-manifold has ""power-exponential"" critical parameter equal to d.","math.MG,math.DG,math.DS,math.FA",2011,human

Here we demonstrate more precisely than before the scenarios in which RLZ excels. We contrast RLZ with alternatives based on block-based adaptive methods, including approaches that ""prime"" the encoding for each block, and measure a range of implementation options using both hard-disk (HDD) and solid-state disk (SSD) drives. For HDD, the dominant factor affecting access speed is the compression rate achieved, even when this involves larger dictionaries and larger blocks.

However, displaced signatures are notoriously difficult to identify due to their ability to evade standard object reconstruction strategies. In particular, the default ATLAS track reconstruction applies strict pointing requirements which limit sensitivity to charged particles originating far from the primary interaction point. To recover efficiency for LLPs decaying within the tracking detector volume, the ATLAS Collaboration employs a dedicated large-radius tracking (LRT) pass with loosened pointing requirements. During Run 2 of the LHC, the LRT implementation produced many incorrectly reconstructed tracks and was therefore only deployed in small subsets of events. In preparation for LHC Run 3, ATLAS has significantly improved both standard and large-radius track reconstruction performance, allowing for LRT to run in all events.

The nuclear modification factors, R$_\mathrm{AA}$, derived from the PbPb-to-pp ratio of yields for each state, are studied as functions of meson rapidity and transverse momentum, as well as PbPb collision centrality. The yields of all three states are found to be significantly suppressed, and compatible with a sequential ordering of the suppression, R$_\mathrm{AA}$($Υ$(1S)) $>$ R$_\mathrm{AA}$($Υ$(2S)) $>$ R$_\mathrm{AA}$($Υ$(3S)) . The suppression of $Υ$(1S) is larger than that seen at $\sqrt{s_{_\mathrm{NN}}} =$ 2.76 TeV, although the two are compatible within uncertainties. The upper limit on the R$_\mathrm{AA}$ of $Υ$(3S) integrated over $p_\mathrm{T}$ and rapidity is 0.094 at 95% confidence level, which is the strongest suppression observed for any hadron species in heavy ion collisions to date.","hep-ex,nucl-ex",2018,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05525v1,Summary of the searches for squarks and gluinos using $\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC,"A summary is presented of ATLAS searches for gluinos and first- and second-generation squarks in final states containing jets and missing transverse momentum, with or without leptons or b-jets, in the $\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV data set collected at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012. This paper reports the results of new interpretations and statistical combinations of previously published analyses, as well as a new analysis. Since no significant excess of events over the Standard Model expectation is observed, the data are used to set limits in a variety of models. In all the considered simplified models that assume R-parity conservation, the limit on the gluino mass exceeds 1150 GeV at 95% confidence level, for an LSP mass smaller than 100 GeV. Furthermore, exclusion limits are set for left-handed squarks in a phenomenological MSSM model, a minimal Supergravity/Constrained MSSM model, R-parity-violation scenarios, a minimal gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking model, a natural gauge mediation model, a non-universal Higgs mass model with gaugino mediation and a minimal model of universal extra dimensions.",hep-ex,2015,human

Otherwise, $Q$ contains $\exists \exists \forall$ or $\exists \forall \exists$ as a subword, and in this case, there is a first-order formula $φ$ whose quantifier prefix is $Q$ and Her$(φ)$ is coNP-complete.

Rapidly rotating, non-axisymmetric neutron stars are expected to emit continuous gravitational waves, whose detection would significantly improve our understanding of the galactic neutron star population and matter under extreme conditions, while also providing valuable tests of general relativity. Neutron stars in binary systems likely constitute a substantial fraction of the unobserved galactic population and, due to potential mass accretion, may emit stronger gravitational-wave signals than their isolated counterparts. This search targets signals from neutron stars with frequencies in the 100-350 Hz range, with orbital periods between 7 and 15 days and projected semi-major axes between 5 and 15 light-seconds. The analysis employs the GPU-accelerated fasttracks pipeline.

The analysis is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3 \text{fb}^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions recorded with the LHCb detector. The most challenging aspect of the analysis is the description of the behaviour of the $π^+ π^-$ S-wave contribution, which is achieved by using three complementary approaches based on the isobar model, the K-matrix formalism, and a quasi-model-independent procedure. Additional resonant contributions for all three methods are described using a common isobar model, and include the $ρ(770)^0$, $ω(782)$ and $ρ(1450)^0$ resonances in the $π^+π^-$ P-wave, the $f_2(1270)$ resonance in the $π^+π^-$ D-wave, and the $ρ_3(1690)^0$ resonance in the $π^+π^-$ F-wave. Significant $C\!P$-violation effects are observed in both S- and D-waves, as well as in the interference between the S- and P-waves.

Cross sections are measured from the observed $H{\rightarrow\,}WW^{\ast}{\rightarrow\,}eνμν$ signal yield in categories distinguished by the number of associated jets. The total cross section is measured in a fiducial region defined by the kinematic properties of the charged leptons and neutrinos. Differential cross sections are reported as a function of the number of jets, the Higgs boson transverse momentum, the dilepton rapidity, and the transverse momentum of the leading jet. The jet-veto efficiency, or fraction of events with no jets above a given transverse momentum threshold, is also reported. All measurements are compared to QCD predictions from Monte Carlo generators and fixed-order calculations, and are in agreement with the Standard Model predictions.",hep-ex,2016,human

http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09334v1,Self-Learning Detector for the Cell-Free Massive MIMO Uplink: The Line-of-Sight Case,"The precoding in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology relies on accurate knowledge of channel responses between users (UEs) and access points (APs). Obtaining high-quality channel estimates in turn requires the path losses between pairs of UEs and APs to be known. These path losses may change rapidly especially in line-of-sight environments with moving blocking objects. A difficulty in the estimation of path losses is pilot contamination, that is, simultaneously transmitted pilots from different UEs that may add up destructively or constructively by chance, seriously affecting the estimation quality (and hence the eventual performance). A method for estimation of path losses, along with an accompanying pilot transmission scheme, is proposed that works for both Rayleigh fading and line-of-sight channels and that significantly improves performance over baseline state-of-the-art. The salient feature of the pilot transmission scheme is that pilots are structurally phase-rotated over different coherence blocks (according to a pre-determined function known to all parties), in order to create an effective statistical distribution of the received pilot signal that can be efficiently exploited by the proposed estimation algorithm.","cs.IT,eess.SP",2020,human

Here, we present a combination of t-NEVPT2 with a matrix product state (MPS) reference wavefunction (t-MPS-NEVPT2) that allows to compute uncontracted dynamic correlation energies for large active spaces and basis sets, using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (td-DMRG) algorithm.

The results are shown after background subtraction and corrections for all detector effects, within a kinematic range closely matched to the experimental acceptance. Several QCD-based Monte Carlo models are compared with the results.

To seamlessly integrate the added control input with existing practices for ordinary computer keyboards, the redefined notion of virtual modifier keys is introduced. A number of application examples are given, especially to point out a potential for simplifying existing interactions by replacing modifier key combinations with single key presses. Also, a new class of interaction scenarios employing the technique is proposed, based on an interaction model named ""What You Touch Is What You Get (WYTIWYG)"". Here, the proposed tactile input method is used to navigate interaction options, get full previews of potential outcomes, and then either commit to one or abort altogether - all in the space of one key depress / release cycle. The results of user testing indicate some remaining implementation issues, as well as that the technique can be learned within about a quarter of an hour of hands-on operating practice time.",cs.HC,2021,human

The masses of the linearized curvature excitations about AdS_3 backgrounds are not only shifted from their flat background values but, more surprisingly, split according to chirality. For all finite values of the topological mass, we find a single bulk degree of freedom with positive energy, and exhibit a complete set of normalizable, finite-energy wave packet solutions. This model can also be written as a sum of two higher-derivative SL(2,R) Chern--Simons theories, weighted by the central charges of the boundary conformal field theory. At two particular ""critical"" values of the couplings, one of these central charges vanishes, and linearized topologically massive gravity becomes equivalent to topologically massive electromagnetism; however, the physics of the bulk wave packets remains unaltered here.","hep-th,gr-qc",2008,human

In this paper we propose a new FBMC based communication system using two orthogonal polarizations for wireless communication systems: dual-polarization FBMC (DP-FBMC). Using this system we can significantly suppress the FBMC intrinsic interference. Therefore in DP-FBMC all the multicarrier techniques used in CP-OFDM systems such as channel equalization, etc., should be applicable without using the complex processing methods required for conventional FBMC. DP-FBMC also has other interesting advantages over CP-OFDM and FBMC: it is more robust in highly dispersive channels, and also to receiver carrier frequency offset (CFO) and timing offset (TO). In our DP-FBMC system we propose three different structures based on different multiplexing techniques. We show that compared to conventional FBMC, one of these DP-FBMC structures has equivalent complexity and equipment requirements. We compare DP-FBMC with other systems through simulations. According to our results DP-FBMC has potential as a promising candidate for future wireless communication networks.",eess.SP,2018,human

It concerns the behavior of solutions to coupled ODE systems that arise from applying mass-action kinetics to a network of chemical reactions. The idea is that if all reactions are reversible in a weak sense, then no species can go extinct. A notion that has been found useful in thinking about persistence is that of ""critical siphon."" We explore the combinatorics of critical siphons, with a view towards the persistence conjecture. We introduce the notions of ""drainable"" and ""self-replicable"" (or autocatalytic) siphons. We show that: every minimal critical siphon is either drainable or self-replicable; reaction networks without drainable siphons are persistent; and non-autocatalytic weakly-reversible networks are persistent. Our results clarify that the difficulties in proving the persistence conjecture are essentially due to competition between drainable and self-replicable siphons.","math.DS,cs.CE,q-bio.MN",2013,human

In particular, a very well-motivated case is that of a new ""dark"" massive vector gauge boson mediator. The mass term for such mediator is most naturally obtained by a ""dark Higgs mechanism"" which leads to the presence of an often long-lived dark Higgs boson whose mass scale is the same as that of the mediator. We study the phenomenology and experimental constraints on two minimal, self-consistent dark sectors that include such a light dark Higgs boson. In one the dark matter is a pseudo-Dirac fermion, in the other a complex scalar. We find that the constraints from BBN and CMB are considerably relaxed in the framework of such minimal dark sectors. We present detection prospects for the dark Higgs boson in existing and projected proton beam-dump experiments. We show that future searches at experiments like Xenon1T or LDMX can probe all the relevant parameter space, complementing the various upcoming indirect constraints from astrophysical observations.","hep-ph,hep-ex",2017,human

We show that for the theory in n spacetime dimensions both the frame-like Lagrangian and its gauge symmetries are encoded in the target supermanifold equipped with the odd vector field, the closed 2-form of ghost degree n-1, and the scalar potential of ghost degree n. These structures satisfy a set of compatibility conditions ensuring the gauge invariance of the theory. The Lagrangian and the gauge symmetries have the same structures as those of AKSZ sigma model so that frame-like formulation can be seen as its presymplectic generalization. In contrast to the conventional AKSZ model the generalization allows to describe systems with local degrees of freedom in terms of finite-dimensional target space. We argue that the proposed frame-like approach is directly related de Donder-Weyl polymomentum Hamiltonian formalism. Along with the standard field-theoretical examples like Einstein-Yang-Mills theory we consider free higher spin fields, multi-frame gravity, and parameterized systems. In particular, we propose the frame-like action for free totally symmetric massless fields that involves all higher spin connections on an equal footing.",hep-th,2013,human

The production of correlated jet pairs was quantified using the rate, $R_{ΔR}$, of ""neighbouring"" jets that accompany ""test"" jets within a given range of angular distance, $ΔR$, in the pseudorapidity--azimuthal angle plane. The jets were measured in the ATLAS calorimeter and were reconstructed using the anti-$k_{t}$ algorithm with radius parameters $d = 0.2$, $0.3$, and $0.4$. $R_{ΔR}$ was measured in different Pb+Pb collision centrality bins, characterized by the total transverse energy measured in the forward calorimeters. A centrality dependence of $R_{ΔR}$ is observed for all three jet radii with $R_{ΔR}$ found to be lower in central collisions than in peripheral collisions. The ratios formed by the $R_{ΔR}$ values in different centrality bins and the values in the 40-80 % centrality bin are presented.","hep-ex,nucl-ex",2015,human

Upper bounds for these genera were produced by using a computer to search for genus one concordances between knots. For the topological slice genus further upper bounds were produced using the algebraic genus. Lower bounds were obtained using a new obstruction from the Seifert form and by use of Donaldson's diagonalization theorem. These results complete the computation of the topological slice genera for all knots with at most 11 crossings and leaves the smooth genera unknown for only two 11-crossing knots.

The framework can be readily used along with a correction framework for systematic biases in anisotropic flow analyses due to various detector inefficiencies. A new recursive algorithm has been developed for higher order correlators for the cases where their direct implementation is not feasible. We propose and discuss new azimuthal observables for anisotropic flow analyses which can be measured for the first time with our new framework. Effects of finite detector granularity on multi-particle correlations are quantified and discussed in detail. We point out the existence of a systematic bias in traditional differential flow analyses which stems solely from the applied selection criteria on particles used in the analyses, and is also present in the ideal case when only flow correlations are present. Finally, we extend the applicability of our generic framework to the case of differential multi-particle correlations.",nucl-ex,2013,human

Regular decompositions of this type involve two structural components: a partition on the vertex set and a partition on the pairs of vertices. The regularity of such decompositions are measured by two parameters: an $ε_1>0$ and a function $ε_2:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow (0,1]$. To each hereditary property $\mathcal{H}$ of $3$-uniform hypergraphs, we associate two corresponding growth functions: $T_{\mathcal{H}}(ε_1,ε_2)$ for the size of the vertex component, and $L_{\mathcal{H}}(ε_1,ε_2)$ for the size of the pairs component. The problem of understanding the asymptotic growth of such functions was introduced in a companion paper, which also proved several results about $T_{\mathcal{H}}$. In this paper we study the possible asymptotic behavior of $L_{\mathcal{H}}$. We show any such function is either constant, bounded above and below by a polynomial, or bounded below by an exponential.

The Fermi-LAT discovered that many if not all novae are GeV gamma ray sources, even though theoretical models had not even considered them as a possible source class. More recently, MAGIC and H.E.S.S. detected TeV gamma rays from a nova. Moreover, there is strong evidence that the gamma rays are produced hadronically, and that the long-studied optical emission by novae is also shock-powered. If this is true, novae should emit a neutrino signal correlated with their gamma-ray and optical signals. We present the first search for neutrinos from novae. Because the neutrino energy spectrum is expected to match the gamma-ray spectrum, we use an IceCube DeepCore event selection focused on GeV-TeV neutrinos. We present results from two searches, one for neutrinos correlated with gamma-ray emission and one for neutrinos correlated with optical emission. The event selection presented here is promising for additional astrophysical transients including gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave sources.",astro-ph.HE,2023,human

We then relate our studies to the classical tilting theory and observe that this modern approach can provide fresh impetus to the study of some old problems. We further show that in order to verify the conjecture it is sufficient to treat those minimal $τ$-tilting infinite algebras where almost all bricks are faithful. Finally, we also prove that minimal extending bricks have open orbits, and consequently obtain a simple proof of the brick analogue of the First Brauer-Thrall Conjecture, recently shown by Schroll and Treffinger using some different techniques.","math.RT,math.RA",2021,human

LLPVs occur only in clusters with [Fe/H]>/= -1.0. In these clusters their frequency of occurrence relative to the number of giant stars appears to be independent of metallicity. Integrated over all metallicities, Baade's Window appears to be deficient in LLPVs. We estimate [Fe/H] values for Baade's Window LLPVs from their period and a log P vs. [Fe/H] relation derived from cluster variables and find that LLPVs with [Fe/H]>/= 0.0 are absent from Baade's Window. We propose that this is because of enhanced mass loss rates in these LLPVs with a consequently abbreviated lifetime compared to lower metallicity LLPVs. A typical lifetime for cluster LLPVs is about 3 x10^5 yrs. Finally, we call attention to the need for a much more complete survey for LLPVs in globular clusters.",astro-ph,1997,human

The measurement is performed with the ALFA sub-detector of ATLAS. Using a fit to the differential elastic cross section in the $|t|$ range from 0.01 GeV$^2$ to 0.1 GeV$^2$ to extrapolate to $|t|\rightarrow 0$, the total cross section, $σ_{\mathrm{tot}}(pp\rightarrow X)$, is measured via the optical theorem to be: $$σ_{\mathrm{tot}}(pp\rightarrow X) = 95.35 \; \pm 0.38 \; ({\mbox{stat.}}) \pm 1.25 \; ({\mbox{exp.}}) \pm 0.37 \; (\mbox{extr.}) \; \mbox{mb},$$ where the first error is statistical, the second accounts for all experimental systematic uncertainties and the last is related to uncertainties in the extrapolation to $|t|\rightarrow 0$.

DMFT becomes exact in the limit of high spatial dimensions or coordination number. Using DMFT the dynamics of correlated electron systems can be investigated non-perturbatively at all interaction strengths, electron densities and temperatures. By merging density functional theory with DMFT a powerful method for the calculation of the properties of correlated electron materials has become available, which is applicable to bulk systems and heterostructures, including topological states of matter. The inclusion of non-local correlations into DMFT makes it possible to explore unconventional superconductivity and the critical behavior at thermal or quantum phase transitions.

Then the connected part of the group of $Γ$-fixed points in $\tilde{G}$ is reductive. We axiomatize the main features of the relationship between this fixed-point group and the pair $(\tilde{G},Γ)$, and consider any group $G$, not just the $Γ$-fixed points of $\tilde{G}$, satisfying the axioms. (In fact, the axioms do not require $Γ$ to act on all of $\tilde{G}$.) If both $\tilde{G}$ and $G$ are $k$-quasisplit, then we can consider their duals $\tilde{G}^*$ and $G^*$. We show the existence of and give an explicit formula for a natural map from semisimple stable conjugacy classes in $G^*(k)$ to those in $\tilde{G}^*(k)$. If $k$ is finite, then our groups are automatically quasisplit, and our result specializes to give a map from semisimple conjugacy classes in $G^*(k)$ to those in $\tilde{G}^*(k)$. Since such classes parametrize packets of irreducible representations of $G(k)$ and $\tilde{G}(k)$, one obtains a mapping of such packets.","math.RT,math.NT",2011,human

Applying results from the authors' previous work, we show that positroid varieties are normal, Cohen-Macaulay, have rational singularities, and are defined as schemes by the vanishing of Plucker coordinates.

Achieving such phase alignment is technically challenging, as it requires tight synchronization among geographically distributed APs. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a differential space-time block coding (DSTBC) approach that bypasses the need for AP phase synchronization. We first provide analytic bounds to the achievable spectral efficiency of CF-mMIMO with phase-unsynchronized APs. Then, we propose a DSTBC-based transmission scheme specifically tailored to CF-mMIMO, which operates without channel state information and does not require any form of phase synchronization among the APs. We derive a closed-form expression for the resulting signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), enabling quantitative comparisons among different DSTBC schemes. Numerical simulations confirm that phase misalignments can significantly impair system performance. In contrast, the proposed DSTBC scheme successfully mitigates these effects, achieving performance comparable to that of fully synchronized systems.","cs.IT,cs.ET,eess.SP",2025,human

The proposed method is able to cluster data from any data source. To demonstrate the methods' potential, multiple features derived from a traffic simulation are used in this paper.   The knowledge of traffic scenario clusters is crucial to accelerate the validation process. The clue of the method is that scenario templates can be generated automatically from actual traffic situations. These templates can be employed in all stages of the development process.

The agent society is divided into multiple layers with supervisors and subordinates. In each layer, the society is divided into multiple clusters. A supervisor controls all subordinates in a cluster locally. Subordinates interact with rivals through reinforcement learning, and report learning information to their corresponding supervisor. Supervisors process the reported information through repeated affiliation-based aggregation and by information exchange with other supervisors, then pass down the reprocessed information to subordinates as guidance. Subordinates, in turn, update learning information according to guidance, following the ""win stay, lose shift"" strategy. Experiments are carried out to test the evolution of cooperation in this closed-loop semi-supervised emergent system with different parameters. We also study the variations and phase transitions in this game setting.","cs.CY,cs.NE,nlin.AO,physics.soc-ph",2020,human

However, existing methods typically depend on proprietary datasets, while publicly available resources often suffer from incomplete speech, inaccurate or missing timestamps, and limited real-world relevance. To address these problems, we propose an automated framework for generating large-scale paralinguistic data and apply it to construct the SynParaSpeech dataset. The dataset comprises 6 paralinguistic categories with 118.75 hours of data and precise timestamps, all derived from natural conversational speech. Our contributions lie in introducing the first automated method for constructing large-scale paralinguistic datasets and releasing the SynParaSpeech corpus, which advances speech generation through more natural paralinguistic synthesis and enhances speech understanding by improving paralinguistic event detection.

We describe the method and present results on our understanding of the solar and atmospheric neutrino fluxes by direct extraction from the corresponding neutrino event rates. We present some tests of different forms of new physics which induce new sources of leptonic flavor transitions in vacuum and in matter which can be performed with the present neutrino data. The aim and potential of future neutrino experiments and facilities to further advance in these fronts is also briefly summarized.

Given $y = A x^\star + e$ and $q$, we seek the smallest set containing $x^\star$ -- hence the one conveying maximal information about $x^\star$ -- that is uniformly recoverable from $y$ without knowing $e$. While exact recovery of $x^\star$ via strong (and often impractical) structural assumptions on $A$ or $x^\star$ (e.g., restricted isometry, sparsity) is well studied, recoverability for arbitrary $A$ and $x^\star$ remains open. Our main result shows that the best that one can hope to recover is $x^\star + \ker(U)$, where $U$ is the unique projection matrix onto the intersection of rowspaces of all possible submatrices of $A$ obtained by deleting $2q$ rows. Moreover, we prove that every $x$ that minimizes the $\ell_0$-norm of $y - A x$ lies in $x^\star + \ker(U)$, which then gives a constructive approach to recover this set.","cs.IT,cs.LG,eess.SP",2025,human

BioTac is a commonly used tactile sensor that enables robots to perceive and respond to physical tactile stimuli. However, the sensor's non-linearity poses challenges in simulating its behavior. In this paper, we first investigate a BioTac simulation that uses temperature, force, and contact point positions to predict the sensor outputs. We show that training with BioTac temperature readings does not yield accurate sensor output predictions during deployment. Consequently, we tested three alternative models, i.e., an XGBoost regressor, a neural network, and a transformer encoder. We train these models without temperature readings and provide a detailed investigation of the window size of the input vectors. We demonstrate that we achieve statistically significant improvements over the baseline network. Furthermore, our results reveal that the XGBoost regressor and transformer outperform traditional feed-forward neural networks in this task.

We propose to resolve these questions by the same approach of using étale analogs of topological and algebraic dynamical systems.   The first question is to define topological entropy for a topological dynamical system $(f,X,Ω)$. The main idea is to make use - in addition to invariant compact subspaces of $(X,Ω)$ - of compactifications of étale covers $π:(f',X',Ω')\rightarrow (f,X,Ω)$, that is $π\circ f'=f\circ π$ and the fibers of $π$ are all finite. We prove some basic results and propose a conjecture, whose validity allows us to prove further results.   The second question is to define topological entropy for algebraic dynamical systems, with the requirement that it should be as close to the pullback on cohomology groups as possible. To this end, we develop an étale analog of algebraic dynamical systems.","math.DS,math.AG,math.GN",2016,human

The addressed inspection planning problem is formulated as a single-depot multiple-vehicle scenario, where the inspection vehicles are constrained by the battery budget limiting their inspection time. The inspection vehicle is assumed to be an autonomous multi-copter with a wide range of possible flight speeds influencing battery consumption. The inspection plan is represented by multiple routes for vehicles providing full coverage over inspection target power lines. On an inspection vehicle mission interruption, which might happen at any time during the execution of the inspection plan, the inspection is re-planned using the remaining vehicles and their remaining battery budgets. Robustness is introduced by choosing a suitable cost function for the initial plan that maximizes the time window for successful re-planning. It enables the remaining vehicles to successfully finish all the inspection targets using their respective remaining battery budgets. A combinatorial metaheuristic algorithm with various cost functions is used for planning and fast re-planning during the inspection.","cs.RO,cs.AI",2023,human

The most natural equivalence on these point clouds is rigid motion or isometry maintaining all inter-point distances. Rigid patterns of point clouds can be reliably compared only by complete isometry invariants that can also be called equivariant descriptors without false negatives (isometric clouds having different descriptions) and without false positives (non-isometric clouds with the same description). Noise and motion in data motivate a search for invariants that are continuous under perturbations of points in a suitable metric.

It also includes well-studied monoids like full matrix monoids over finite fields and the monoid of binary relations (i.e., matrices over the Boolean semiring). Our answer reduces the computation to considerations of permutation representations of maximal subgroups that are faithful when restricted to distinguished normal subgroups. This is analogous to (and inspired by) recent results of the second author on the minimal number of irreducible constituents in a faithful completely reducible complex matrix representation of a finite semigroup that admits one. To illustrate what happens when a finite semigroup does not admit a faithful completely reducible representation, we compute the minimum faithful degree of the opposite monoid of the full transformation monoid.",math.GR,2023,human

The policy model can exploit a vanilla Reward Model (RM) by generating acoustic artifacts to achieve spurious rewards, but at the cost of degrading perceptual quality. To address this, we propose Robust Reward Policy Optimization (RRPO), a novel framework that employs a hybrid regularization scheme. This scheme develops a robust RM whose reward signal is more reliably aligned with human perception, compelling the policy to abandon detrimental shortcuts and instead learn the complex features of genuine emotions. Our ablation study confirms the enhanced robustness of our RM, as evidenced by its strong cross-lingual generalization. The subjective evaluation demonstrates that this robust RM effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to significant improvements in both emotional expressiveness and naturalness over all baselines.

We add to this picture by studying cubulations of arbitrary Gromov hyperbolic groups $G$. Under weak assumptions, we show that the space of cubulations of $G$ naturally injects into the space of $G$-invariant cross ratios on the Gromov boundary $\partial_{\infty}G$.   A consequence of our results is that essential, hyperplane-essential cubulations of hyperbolic groups are length-spectrum rigid, i.e. they are fully determined by their length function. This is the optimal length-spectrum rigidity result for cubulations of hyperbolic groups, as we demonstrate with some examples. In the hyperbolic setting, this constitutes a strong improvement on our previous work in arXiv:1903.02447.   Along the way, we describe the relationship between the Roller boundary of a ${\rm CAT(0)}$ cube complex, its Gromov boundary and - in the non-hyperbolic case - the contracting boundary of Charney and Sultan.

First, the mixed-traffic cooperative merging problem was formulated. Then, a real-world merging trajectory dataset was processed to generate dangerous merging scenarios. Aiming at resolving the potential collision risks in mixed traffic where CAVs and traditional human-driven vehicles (THVs) coexist, we proposed on-ramp merging strategies for CAVs in different mixed traffic situations considering the connected vehicle identification process.

Each edge is weighted with a \textit{transmission probability} that represents the likelihood of the pair existing and a \textit{coherence probability} which is the likelihood that the pair is suitable for teleportation. Routing operations such as entanglement swapping and purification are then interpreted as \textit{contractions on the multi-graph} with relatively simple rules for updating the edge-weights. Moreover, we extend our formalism to include routing scenarios over time by developing a compatible resource theory for quantum memories. We develop rudimentary greedy algorithms for routing in this framework and test them over a variety of toy networking scenarios.

Particularly, as the number of IRS reflecting elements and/or that of IRS-served users increase, the channel training overhead becomes excessively high. To tackle this challenge, we propose in this paper a new anchor-assisted two-phase channel estimation scheme, where two anchor nodes, namely A1 and A2, are deployed near the IRS for helping the base station (BS) to acquire the cascaded BS-IRS-user channels. Specifically, in the first phase, the partial channel state information (CSI), i.e., the element-wise channel gain square, of the BS-IRS link is obtained by estimating the BS-IRS-A1/A2 channels and the A1-IRS-A2 channel, separately. Then, in the second phase, by leveraging such partial knowledge of the BS-IRS channel that is common to all users, the individual cascaded BS-IRS-user channels are efficiently estimated. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed anchor-assisted channel estimation scheme is able to achieve comparable mean-squared error (MSE) performance as compared to the conventional scheme, but with significantly reduced channel training time.","cs.IT,eess.SP",2020,human

Constructing EPGP-priors is algorithmic, generally applicable, and comes with a sparse version (S-EPGP) that learns the relevant spectral frequencies and works better for big data sets. We demonstrate our approach on three families of systems of PDEs, the heat equation, wave equation, and Maxwell's equations, where we improve upon the state of the art in computation time and precision, in some experiments by several orders of magnitude.","stat.ML,cs.LG,math.AC,math.NA",2022,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10003v1,MTP-S2UT: Enhancing Speech-to-Speech Translation Quality with Multi-token Prediction,"Current direct speech-to-speech translation methods predominantly employ speech tokens as intermediate representations. However, a single speech token is not dense in semantics, so we generally need multiple tokens to express a complete semantic unit. To address this limitation, we introduce multi-token prediction (MTP) loss into speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) models, enabling models to predict multiple subsequent tokens at each position, thereby capturing more complete semantics and enhancing information density per position. Initial MTP implementations apply the loss at the final layer, which improves output representation but initiates information enrichment too late. We hypothesize that advancing the information enrichment process to intermediate layers can achieve earlier and more effective enhancement of hidden representation. Consequently, we propose MTP-S2UT loss, applying MTP loss to hidden representation where CTC loss is computed. Experiments demonstrate that all MTP loss variants consistently improve the quality of S2UT translation, with MTP-S2UT achieving the best performance.","cs.CL,cs.SD,eess.AS",2025,human

Leveraging data analytics has now enabled the collection of deep insights into the performance and, as a result, the optimization of assets. Industrial drives, for example, already accumulate all the necessary information to control electric machines. These signals include but are not limited to currents, frequency, and temperature. Integrating machine learning (ML) models responsible for predicting the evolution of those directly collected or implicitly derived parameters enhances the smartness of industrial systems even further. In this article, data already residing in most modern electric drives has been used to develop a data-driven thermal model of a power module. A test bench has been designed and used specifically for training and validating the thermal digital twin undergoing various static and dynamic operating profiles. Different approaches, from traditional linear models to deep neural networks, have been implemented to emanate the best ML model for estimating the case temperature of a power module. Several evaluation metrics were then used to assess the investigated methods' performance and implementation in industrial embedded systems.",cs.LG,2025,human

Choosing the best one for a set of tasks is the subject of many recent publications. However, one aspect often overlooked in these works is the influence of the duration of audio input considered to extract an embedding, which we refer to as Temporal Support (TS). In this work, we study the influence of the TS for well-established or emerging pre-trained embeddings, chosen to represent different types of architectures and learning paradigms. We conduct this evaluation using both musical instrument and environmental sound datasets, namely OpenMIC, TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2020 Mobile, and ESC-50. We especially highlight that Audio Spectrogram Transformer-based systems (PaSST and BEATs) remain effective with smaller TS, which therefore allows for a drastic reduction in memory and computational cost. Moreover, we show that by choosing the optimal TS we reach competitive results across all tasks. In particular, we improve the state-of-the-art results on OpenMIC, using BEATs and PaSST without any fine-tuning.","cs.SD,cs.AI,eess.AS",2023,human

The follower UAVs maintain a predetermined formation relative to the worker's position, providing additional perspectives of the monitored scene. Hand gestures enable the human worker to specify movement and action commands for the UAV team and to initiate other mission-related tasks without requiring additional communication channels or specific markers. Combined with a novel unified human detection and tracking algorithm, a human position estimation method, and a gesture detection pipeline, the proposed approach represents the first instance of an HSI system incorporating all these modules onboard real-world UAVs.

Model-free Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms struggle with the joint challenge of representation learning, partial observability, and credit assignment. To address this, we propose a novel framework based on a shared, generative Multimodal World Model (MWM). Our MWM is trained to learn a compressed latent representation of the environment's dynamics by fusing distributed, multimodal observations from all agents using a scalable attention-based mechanism. Subsequently, we leverage this learned MWM as a fast, ""imagined"" simulator to train cooperative MARL policies (e.g., MAPPO) entirely within its latent space, decoupling representation learning from policy learning. We introduce a new set of challenging multimodal, multi-agent benchmarks built on a 3D physics simulator. Our experiments demonstrate that our MWM-MARL framework achieves orders-of-magnitude greater sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art model-free MARL baselines. We further show that our proposed multimodal fusion is essential for task success in environments with sensory asymmetry and that our architecture provides superior robustness to sensor-dropout, a critical feature for real-world deployment.",cs.MA,2025,human

We moreover show that a large variety of specification monads can be obtained by applying monad transformers to various base specification monads, including predicate transformers and Hoare-style pre- and postconditions. For defining correct monad transformers, we propose a language inspired by Moggi's monadic metalanguage that is parameterized by a dependent type theory. We also develop a notion of algebraic operations for Dijkstra monads, and start to investigate two ways of also accommodating effect handlers.

We do this on the one hand by modifying the network architecture and introducing a CrossNet structure. On the other hand, we consider combinations of instrument estimates by using a new combination loss (CL). MDL and CL can easily be applied to many existing DNN-based separation methods as they are merely loss functions which are only used during training and which do not affect the inference step.

Inspired by game theoretic notions, this paper introduces a framework for incentive-aware learning and data sharing in federated learning. Our stable and envy-free equilibria capture notions of collaboration in the presence of agents interested in meeting their learning objectives while keeping their own sample collection burden low. For example, in an envy-free equilibrium, no agent would wish to swap their sampling burden with any other agent and in a stable equilibrium, no agent would wish to unilaterally reduce their sampling burden.   In addition to formalizing this framework, our contributions include characterizing the structural properties of such equilibria, proving when they exist, and showing how they can be computed. Furthermore, we compare the sample complexity of incentive-aware collaboration with that of optimal collaboration when one ignores agents' incentives.","cs.LG,cs.DS,cs.GT",2021,human

While discriminative models have traditionally been argued to be more powerful e.g. for speech enhancement, generative diffusion approaches have recently been shown to narrow this performance gap considerably. In this paper, we systematically compare the performance of generative diffusion models and discriminative approaches on different speech restoration tasks. For this, we extend our prior contributions on diffusion-based speech enhancement in the complex time-frequency domain to the task of bandwith extension. We then compare it to a discriminatively trained neural network with the same network architecture on three restoration tasks, namely speech denoising, dereverberation and bandwidth extension.

Forming shortly after matter-radiation equality, these objects would develop very dense and spiky dark matter profiles. In the standard scenario where dark matter consists of thermally-produced, weakly-interacting massive particles, UCMHs could thus appear as highly luminous gamma-ray sources, or leave an imprint in the cosmic microwave background by changing the reionisation history of the Universe. We derive corresponding limits on the cosmic abundance of UCMHs at different epochs, and translate them into constraints on the primordial power spectrum. We find the resulting constraints to be quite severe, especially at length scales much smaller than what can be directly probed by the cosmic microwave background or large-scale structure observations.

In this paper, this outlook is problematised in two ways. First, it is observed that generative AI is not a neutral vehicle of intention. Multiple recent studies paint a picture of the ""mechanised convergence"" phenomenon, namely, that generative AI has a homogenising effect on intention. Second, it is observed that the formation of intention itself is immensely challenging. Constraints, materiality, and resistance can offer paths to design metaphors for intentional tools. Finally, existentialist approaches to intention are discussed and possible implications for programming are proposed in the form of a speculative, illustrative set of intentional programming practices.",cs.HC,2024,human

By using duality, we show that a class of one-flavor theories exhibit new physical phenomena: discrete chiral symmetry breaking induced by the condensation of topological disorder operators, and confinement and the generation of mass gap due to new non-selfdual topological excitations. In the R*4 limit, we argue that the mass gap disappears, the chiral symmetry breaking vacua are of runaway type, and the theory flows to a CFT. We also study mixed-representation theories and find abelian chiral symmetry breaking by topological operators charged under abelian chiral symmetries. These are reminiscent to, but distinct, from Seiberg-Witten theory with matter, where 4d monopoles have non-abelian chiral charge. This examination also helps us refine our recent bounds on the conformal window.

For this purpose, we introduce a language close to SPARQL where queries can be nested at will, involving either CONSTRUCT or SELECT query forms and provide a formal semantics for it.

Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.","cs.CL,cs.LG",2017,human

We call such totally geodesic suborbifolds finite centraliser subspaces (or fc-subspaces) and use them to formulate an arithmeticity criterion for hyperbolic lattices.   We show that a hyperbolic orbifold $M$ is arithmetic if and only if it has infinitely many fc-subspaces, and exhibit examples of non-arithmetic orbifolds that contain non-fc subspaces of codimension one. We provide an algebraic characterization of totally geodesically immersed suborbifolds of arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds by analysing Vinberg's commensurability invariants. This allows us to construct examples with the property that the adjoint trace field of the geodesic suborbifold properly contains the adjoint trace field of the orbifold. The case of special interest is that of exceptional trialitarian $7$-dimensional orbifolds. We show that every such orbifold contains a totally geodesic arithmetic hyperbolic $3$-orbifold of exceptional type.   Finally, we study arithmetic properties of orbifolds that descend to their totally geodesic suborbifolds, proving that all suborbifolds in a (quasi-)arithmetic orbifold are (quasi-)arithmetic.","math.GT,math.DG,math.GR,math.MG,math.NT",2021,human

To evaluate our architecture, we apply it to our proposed new architecture on a spin-fermion model on a two-dimensional lattice. We find that it overcomes poor acceptance rates for linear models and observe the scaling law of the acceptance rate as in the large language models with Transformers.","hep-lat,cond-mat.dis-nn,cs.LG",2023,human

As most inversion methods build upon Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we transfer a hierarchical vision Transformer backbone innovatively to predict $\mathcal{W^+}$ latent codes at token level. We further apply a Style-driven Multi-scale Adaptive Refinement Transformer (SMART) in $\mathcal{F}$ space to refine the intermediate style features of the generator. By treating style features as queries to retrieve lost identity information from the encoder's feature maps, SMART can not only produce high-quality inverted images but also surprisingly adapt to editing tasks. We then prove that StylePrompter lies in a more disentangled $\mathcal{W^+}$ and show the controllability of SMART. Finally, quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that StylePrompter can achieve desirable performance in balancing reconstruction quality and editability, and is ""smart"" enough to fit into most edits, outperforming other $\mathcal{F}$-involved inversion methods.",cs.CV,2023,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.6086v1,"In All Likelihood, Deep Belief Is Not Enough","Statistical models of natural stimuli provide an important tool for researchers in the fields of machine learning and computational neuroscience. A canonical way to quantitatively assess and compare the performance of statistical models is given by the likelihood. One class of statistical models which has recently gained increasing popularity and has been applied to a variety of complex data are deep belief networks. Analyses of these models, however, have been typically limited to qualitative analyses based on samples due to the computationally intractable nature of the model likelihood. Motivated by these circumstances, the present article provides a consistent estimator for the likelihood that is both computationally tractable and simple to apply in practice. Using this estimator, a deep belief network which has been suggested for the modeling of natural image patches is quantitatively investigated and compared to other models of natural image patches. Contrary to earlier claims based on qualitative results, the results presented in this article provide evidence that the model under investigation is not a particularly good model for natural images","stat.ML,cs.LG",2010,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05422v2,Tracking Everything Everywhere All at Once,"We present a new test-time optimization method for estimating dense and long-range motion from a video sequence. Prior optical flow or particle video tracking algorithms typically operate within limited temporal windows, struggling to track through occlusions and maintain global consistency of estimated motion trajectories. We propose a complete and globally consistent motion representation, dubbed OmniMotion, that allows for accurate, full-length motion estimation of every pixel in a video. OmniMotion represents a video using a quasi-3D canonical volume and performs pixel-wise tracking via bijections between local and canonical space. This representation allows us to ensure global consistency, track through occlusions, and model any combination of camera and object motion. Extensive evaluations on the TAP-Vid benchmark and real-world footage show that our approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by a large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively.

We present an efficient Multi-person Pose Tracking method, KeyTrack, that only relies on keypoint information without using any RGB or optical flow information to track human keypoints in real-time. Keypoints are tracked using our Pose Entailment method, in which, first, a pair of pose estimates is sampled from different frames in a video and tokenized. Then, a Transformer-based network makes a binary classification as to whether one pose temporally follows another. Furthermore, we improve our top-down pose estimation method with a novel, parameter-free, keypoint refinement technique that improves the keypoint estimates used during the Pose Entailment step.

A typical corrupted training example requires altering both the image, by applying the trigger, and the label. Models trained on clean images, therefore, were considered safe from backdoor attacks. However, in some common machine learning scenarios, the training labels are provided by potentially malicious third-parties. This includes crowd-sourced annotation and knowledge distillation. We, hence, investigate a fundamental question: can we launch a successful backdoor attack by only corrupting labels? We introduce a novel approach to design label-only backdoor attacks, which we call FLIP, and demonstrate its strengths on three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet) and four architectures (ResNet-32, ResNet-18, VGG-19, and Vision Transformer). With only 2% of CIFAR-10 labels corrupted, FLIP achieves a near-perfect attack success rate of 99.4% while suffering only a 1.8% drop in the clean test accuracy.

It was previously established that the large-$N$ limit of the second moment (the planar two-point function) satisfies a non-linear integral equation.

For finite $N$, the two-point function is a rational function evaluated at the preimages of another rational function $R$ constructed from the spectrum of $E$. Subsequent work has constructed from this formula a family $ω_{g,n}$ of meromorphic differentials which obey blobbed topological recursion. For unbounded operators $E$, the renormalised two-point function is given by an integral formula involving a regularisation of $R$.

Our model addresses some of the shortcomings of classical GANs: (1) It is able to remove large objects, such as glasses.

In dimension $5$, we construct solutions on the product of a closed Riemann surface and $\mathbb{R}^3$. The solutions are invariant in the $\mathbb{R}^3$ directions and can be related to vortices on the Riemann surface. A key issue in higher dimensions is the potential noncompactness of the space of solutions, in contrast to the compact moduli spaces in lower dimensions.

Through analysis of O1's outputs and provided sample Chain-of-Thought (CoT) demonstrations, we observe that it approaches problem-solving in a distinctly human-like manner, systematically brainstorming ideas, testing hypotheses, verifying results, and planning comprehensive solutions. These sophisticated reasoning capabilities remain notably absent in other state-of-the-art language models. In this paper, we hypothesize that this performance gap stems from the limited availability of high-quality reasoning process data in current training sets. We demonstrate that by constructing a specialized dataset focused on explicit problem-solving workflows (""worked solutions""), we can elicit substantially improved planning capabilities from existing models. Additionally, we propose the Reasoning Enhancement Loop (REL), a method for generating synthetic worked solutions.",cs.AI,2024,human

While most ribbons appear connected to the corona, and they over-lie regions of significant vertical magnetic field, we examine one ribbon with no clear evidence for such connections. Evolving horizontal magnetic fields seen with Hinode suggest that reconnection with pre-existing fields below the corona can explain the data. The identification of just one, albeit small, ribbon, with no apparent connection to the corona, leads us to conclude that at least two mechanisms are responsible for the heating that leads to flare ribbon emission.",astro-ph.SR,2017,human

The validity of these simple power laws across orders of magnitude in model scale provides compelling evidence that larger models are also more capable models. However, scaling up models under the constraints of hardware and infrastructure is no easy feat, and rapidly becomes a hard and expensive engineering problem. We investigate ways to tentatively cheat scaling laws, and train larger models for cheaper. We emulate an increase in effective parameters, using efficient approximations: either by doping the models with frozen random parameters, or by using fast structured transforms in place of dense linear layers.

We challenge this convention by introducing top-$nσ$, a novel sampling method that operates directly on pre-softmax logits by leveraging a statistical threshold. Our key insight is that logits naturally separate into a Gaussian-distributed noisy region and a distinct informative region, enabling efficient token filtering without complex probability manipulations. Unlike existing methods (e.g., top-$p$, min-$p$) that inadvertently include more noise tokens at higher temperatures, top-$nσ$ maintains a stable sampling space regardless of temperature scaling.

Approaches of this sort are particularly relevant for quantum information, where exact downfolding would allow eigenstates in a large Hilbert space to be simulated with fewer qubits. Very little work has been done to prove the existence of such an exact downfolding for general systems or even particular cases. In this letter we prove that exact quantum downfolding is impossible for what is perhaps the most commonly-used formulation of the task. Specifically, for a non-trivial Hamiltonian $\mathbf{H}(x)\equiv\mathbf{A}+x\mathbf{B}$ that depends on some parameter $x$ (e.g. an electric field, bond length or interaction strength) it is not possible to construct a lower-dimension effective Hamiltonian $\mathbf{h}(x)\equiv\mathbf{a}+x\mathbf{b}$ that exactly recovers \emph{any} of the eigenvalue functions $E_i(x)$ of $\mathbf{H}(x)$.

This paper studies the extent of biases absorbed by LLMs during pre-training as well as task-specific behaviour after fine-tuning. We found that controlled interventions on pre-trained LLMs, prior to fine-tuning, have minimal effect on lowering biases in classifiers. However, the biases present in domain-specific datasets play a much bigger role, and hence mitigating them at this stage has a bigger impact.

The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the standard WSJ0-2/3mix datasets. It reaches an SI-SNRi of 22.3 dB on WSJ0-2mix and an SI-SNRi of 19.5 dB on WSJ0-3mix. The SepFormer inherits the parallelization advantages of Transformers and achieves a competitive performance even when downsampling the encoded representation by a factor of 8. It is thus significantly faster and it is less memory-demanding than the latest speech separation systems with comparable performance.","eess.AS,cs.LG,cs.SD,eess.SP",2020,human

Beginning with the one-dimensional case, we prove that with $k$ eggs and $N$ floors, the minimal number of drops in the worst case satisfies $P_1(k) \leq \lceil k N^{1/k} \rceil$. We then extend the recursive algorithm to two and three dimensions, proving similar formulas: $P_2(k) \leq \lceil (k-1)(M+N)^{1/(k-1)} \rceil $ in 2D and $P_3(k) \leq \lceil (k-2)(L+M+N)^{1/(k-2)} \rceil$ in 3D, and conjecture a general formula for the $d$-dimensional case. Beyond the critical point problems, we then study the critical line problems, where the breaking condition occurs along $x+y=V$ (with slope $-1$) or, more generally, $αx+βy=V$ (with the slope of the line unknown). We discuss how one frequently has to pivot from the original problem, which is intractable, to something that can be solved; in our case, using induction and recursion, two standard proof techniques.",math.HO,2025,human

It has had great success on sparse recovery. In this paper, we show that adding momentum to intermediate variables in the LISTA network achieves a better convergence rate and, in particular, the network with instance-optimal parameters is superlinearly convergent. Moreover, our new theoretical results lead to a practical approach of automatically and adaptively calculating the parameters of a LISTA network layer based on its previous layers. Perhaps most surprisingly, such an adaptive-parameter procedure reduces the training of LISTA to tuning only three hyperparameters from data: a new record set in the context of the recent advances on trimming down LISTA complexity. We call this new ultra-light weight network HyperLISTA. Compared to state-of-the-art LISTA models, HyperLISTA achieves almost the same performance on seen data distributions and performs better when tested on unseen distributions (specifically, those with different sparsity levels and nonzero magnitudes).

To enhance the robustness of such models, we introduce the use of Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) as a novel data augmentation technique for end-to-end ADS. CFEs, by generating training samples near decision boundaries through minimal input modifications, lead to a more comprehensive representation of expert driver strategies, particularly in safety-critical scenarios. This approach can therefore help improve the model's ability to handle rare and challenging driving events, such as anticipating darting out pedestrians, ultimately leading to safer and more trustworthy decision-making for ADS. Our experiments in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that CF-Driver outperforms the current state-of-the-art method, achieving a higher driving score and lower infraction rates. Specifically, CF-Driver attains a driving score of 84.2, surpassing the previous best model by 15.02 percentage points. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating CFEs in training end-to-end ADS. To foster further research, the CF-Driver code is made publicly available.","cs.CV,cs.LG",2024,human

The contextual nature of a theory is often witnessed via the violation of non-contextuality inequalities---certain linear inequalities involving probabilities of measurement events. Using the exclusivity graph approach (one of the two main graph theoretic approaches for studying contextuality), it was shown [PRA 88, 032104 (2013); Annals of mathematics, 51-299 (2006)] that a necessary and sufficient condition for witnessing contextuality is the presence of an odd number of events (greater than three) which are either cyclically or anti-cyclically exclusive. Thus, the non-contextuality inequalities whose underlying exclusivity structure is as stated, either cyclic or anti-cyclic, are fundamental to quantum theory. We show that there is a unique non-contextuality inequality for each non-trivial cycle and anti-cycle. In addition to the foundational interest, we expect this to aid the understanding of contextuality as a resource to quantum computing and its applications to local self-testing.",quant-ph,2018,human

Most of the existing methods operate with either spectrograms or waveforms. Spectrogram based models learn suitable masks for separating magnitude spectrogram into different sources, and waveform-based models directly generate waveforms of individual sources. The two types of models have complementary strengths; the former is superior given harmonic sources such as vocals, while the latter demonstrates better results for percussion and bass instruments. In this work, we improved upon the state-of-the-art (SoTA) models and successfully combined the best of both worlds. The backbones of the proposed framework, dubbed Danna-Sep, are two spectrogram-based models including a modified X-UMX and U-Net, and an enhanced Demucs as the waveform-based model. Given an input of mixture, we linearly combined respective outputs from the three models to obtain the final result. We showed in the experiments that, despite its simplicity, Danna-Sep surpassed the SoTA models by a large margin in terms of Source-to-Distortion Ratio.","eess.AS,cs.SD",2021,human

Unlike CP, PARAFAC2 allows factor matrices in one mode (i.e., evolving mode) to change across tensor slices, which has proven useful for applications in different domains such as chemometrics, and neuroscience. However, the evolving mode of the PARAFAC2 model is traditionally modelled implicitly, which makes it challenging to regularise it. Currently, the only way to apply regularisation on that mode is with a flexible coupling approach, which finds the solution through regularised least-squares subproblems. In this work, we instead propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm for fitting PARAFAC2 and widen the possible regularisation penalties to any proximable function. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed ADMM-based approach for PARAFAC2 can accurately recover the underlying components from simulated data while being both computationally efficient and flexible in terms of imposing constraints.","cs.LG,math.OC,stat.ML",2021,human

We also identify a set of symmetry-protected Floquet drives that lie outside of the group cohomology construction, and a further class of symmetry-respecting topological drives which host chiral edge modes. We use these special drives to define a notion of phase (stable to a class of local perturbations in the bulk) and the concepts of relative and absolute topological order, which can be applied to many different classes of unitary evolutions. These include fully many-body localized unitary evolutions and time crystals.","cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.quant-gas",2016,human

This paper introduces a new paradigm toward the universal medical image segmentation, termed 'One-Prompt Segmentation.' One-Prompt Segmentation combines the strengths of one-shot and interactive methods. In the inference stage, with just \textbf{one prompted sample}, it can adeptly handle the unseen task in a single forward pass. We train One-Prompt Model on 64 open-source medical datasets, accompanied by the collection of over 3,000 clinician-labeled prompts.

HydraSub encompasses multiple branches, each representing a distinct subsampling rate, allowing for the flexible selection of any branch during inference based on the specific use case. HydraFormer can efficiently manage different subsampling rates, significantly reducing training and deployment expenses. Experiments on AISHELL-1 and LibriSpeech datasets reveal that HydraFormer effectively adapts to various subsampling rates and languages while maintaining high recognition performance.

Our SegReg first decomposes input moving and fixed images into anatomically coherent subregions through segmentation. These localized domains are then processed by the same registration backbone to compute optimized partial deformation fields, which are subsequently integrated into a global deformation field. SegReg achieves near-perfect structural alignment (98.23% Dice on critical anatomies) using ground-truth segmentation, and outperforms existing methods by 2-12% across three clinical registration scenarios (cardiac, abdominal, and lung images) even with automatic segmentation. Our SegReg demonstrates a near-linear dependence of registration accuracy on segmentation quality, transforming the registration challenge into a segmentation problem.

Several recent works on runtime monitoring have focused on out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, i.e., identifying inputs that are different from the training data. In this work, we argue that OOD detection is not a well-suited framework to design efficient runtime monitors and that it is more relevant to evaluate monitors based on their ability to discard incorrect predictions. We call this setting out-ofmodel-scope detection and discuss the conceptual differences with OOD. We also conduct extensive experiments on popular datasets from the literature to show that studying monitors in the OOD setting can be misleading: 1. very good OOD results can give a false impression of safety, 2. comparison under the OOD setting does not allow identifying the best monitor to detect errors.

To address these issues, we propose Conditional Token Selection (CTS), a token-level compression framework with a flexible and variable compression ratio that identifies and preserves only the most essential tokens in CoT. CTS evaluates each token's contribution to deriving correct answers using conditional importance scoring, then trains models on compressed CoT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CTS effectively compresses long CoT while maintaining strong reasoning performance. Notably, on the GPQA benchmark, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct trained with CTS achieves a 9.1% accuracy improvement with 13.2% fewer reasoning tokens (13% training token reduction).

http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18770v1,Any four real numbers are on all fours with analogy,"This work presents a formalization of analogy on numbers that relies on generalized means. It is motivated by recent advances in artificial intelligence and applications of machine learning, where the notion of analogy is used to infer results, create data and even as an assessment tool of object representations, or embeddings, that are basically collections of numbers (vectors, matrices, tensors). This extended analogy use asks for mathematical foundations and clear understanding of the notion of analogy between numbers. We propose a unifying view of analogies that relies on generalized means defined in terms of a power parameter. In particular, we show that any four increasing positive real numbers is an analogy in a unique suitable power. In addition, we show that any such analogy can be reduced to an equivalent arithmetic analogy and that any analogical equation has a solution for increasing numbers, which generalizes without restriction to complex numbers. These foundational results provide a better understanding of analogies in areas where representations are numerical.",cs.AI,2024,human

By formulating the managed traffic network as a nonlinear stochastic dynamical system, we can quantify in a more realistic way the impacts of driver route choices and thus determine appropriate tolls. Specially, we focus on a network comprised of one corridor and one local street. We assume that a reasonable routing policy is specified in advance. However, drivers could be reluctant to be detoured. Thus a fixed toll is set on the corridor to give drivers incentives to choose the local street.

Under these assumptions, we prove that the model undergoes a sharp phase transition around its critical point $\ell_c$. More precisely, we show that connection probabilities decay exponentially for $\ell<\ell_c$ and percolation occurs in sufficiently thick 2D slabs for $\ell>\ell_c$. This extends results recently obtained in dimension $d=2$ to arbitrary dimensions through completely different techniques. The result follows from a global comparison with a truncated (i.e. with finite range of dependence) and discretized (i.e. defined on the lattice $\varepsilon\mathbb{Z}^d$) version of the model, which may be of independent interest.

As it is independent of the X-ray fluxes, the measure allows us to compare the accretion rate dependency of the bolometric X-ray luminosity of BHs and NSs. For NSs, it scales linearly with accretion rate while the scaling for BHs is quadratic - as expected for inefficient accretion flows. We find the same behaviour in AGN. This new approach uses the jet power to obtain the accretion rate. Thus, we know both the jet power and the radiated power of an accreting BH. This allows us to show that some accretion power is likely to be advected into the black hole, while the jet power dominates over the bolometric luminosity of a hard state BH.",astro-ph,2006,human

Existing literature has studied many of the shortcomings of neural architectures on tabular data and has repeatedly confirmed the scalability and robustness of gradient-boosted decision trees across varied datasets. However, recent deep learning models have not been subjected to a comprehensive evaluation under conditions that allow for a fair comparison with existing classical approaches. This situation motivates an investigation into whether recent deep-learning paradigms outperform classical ML methods on tabular data.

The best algorithm to select a parenthesisation that minimises the cost runs in $O(n \log n)$ time. Approximate algorithms run in $O(n)$ time and find solutions that are guaranteed to be within a certain factor from optimal; the best factor is currently $1.155$. In this article, we first prove two results that characterise different parenthesisations, and then use those results to improve on the best known approximation algorithms. Specifically, we show that (a) each parenthesisation is optimal somewhere in the problem domain, and (b) exactly $n + 1$ parenthesisations are essential in the sense that the removal of any one of them causes an unbounded penalty for an infinite number of problem instances. By focusing on essential parenthesisations, we improve on the best known approximation algorithm and show that the approximation factor is at most $1.143$.",cs.DM,2023,human

The first result: The category of exceptional covers of a normal variety, Z, over a finite field, F_q, has fiber products, and therefore a natural Galois group (with permutation representation) limit. This has many applications to considering Poincare series attached to diophantine questions. The paper follows three lines:   * The historical role of the Galois Theoretic property of exceptionality, first considered by Davenport and Lewis.   * How the tower structure on the category of exceptional covers of a pair (Z,F_q) allows forming subtowers that separate known results from unknown territory.   * The use of Serre's OIT, especially the GL_2 case, to consider cryptology periods and functional composition aspects of exceptionality.

Although there are many methods on Transformer acceleration, they are still either inefficient on long sequences or not effective enough. In this paper, we propose Fastformer, which is an efficient Transformer model based on additive attention. In Fastformer, instead of modeling the pair-wise interactions between tokens, we first use additive attention mechanism to model global contexts, and then further transform each token representation based on its interaction with global context representations.

While the core accretion paradigm is widely accepted as the dominant mechanism for forming low- and intermediate-mass planets, the origin of the most massive planets remains debated, with gravitational instability often invoked to explain their existence. In this study, we analyze the dependence of planet formation on metallicity using the total heavy-element mass fraction (Z), which is a proxy for the composition of the protoplanetary disk inferred from stellar photospheres. We show that even the most massive planets form preferentially in metal-rich environments. Z correlates not only with the presence of planets, but also with planetary system multiplicity and total planetary mass. The most massive planets are found in the most metal-rich environments, and, in agreement with core-accretion theory, only the upper end of the planetary mass distribution shows a clear positive correlation with metallicity. These findings suggest that the chemical enrichment of protoplanetary disks plays a central role in shaping the full spectrum of planetary masses.","astro-ph.EP,astro-ph.SR",2025,human

Existing work predicts religion using dictionary based method, and therefore, can not classify unseen names. We use character based models which learn character patterns and, therefore, can classify unseen names as well with high accuracy.

We improve our classifier by combining the name of an individual with that of their parent/spouse and achieve remarkably high accuracy.

The observed lognormal Sigma is consistent with predictions of hierarchically structured star-formation at scales below 10 pc, arising from the molecular cloud structures. We do not find evidence for multiple discrete modes of star-formation (e.g. clustered and distributed). Comparing the observed Sigma distribution to previous Sigma threshold definitions of clusters show that they are arbitrary.

This latter relation partially solve or, equivalently, localize the computational complexity of evaluating the series expansion to a simple fraction of those coefficients. As a bonus, those relations also encode non-trivial equalities between different geometric constructions in general dimensions, and connect derived coefficients to polytope volumes.

This replacement reduces the cache size without evicting tokens, thus maintaining generation quality. RecurFormer retains the ability to model long-range dependencies through the remaining attention heads and allows for reusing pre-trained Transformer-based LLMs weights with continual training. Experiments demonstrate that RecurFormer matches the original model's performance while significantly enhancing inference efficiency. Our approach provides a practical solution to the computational challenges of Transformer-based LLMs inference, making it highly attractive for tasks involving long inputs.","cs.CL,cs.AI,cs.LG",2024,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00045v2,Performance is not All You Need: Sustainability Considerations for Algorithms,"This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning. Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.","cs.CV,cs.PF",2025,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01894v4,An efficient manifold density estimator for all recommendation systems,"Many unsupervised representation learning methods belong to the class of similarity learning models. While various modality-specific approaches exist for different types of data, a core property of many methods is that representations of similar inputs are close under some similarity function. We propose EMDE (Efficient Manifold Density Estimator) - a framework utilizing arbitrary vector representations with the property of local similarity to succinctly represent smooth probability densities on Riemannian manifolds. Our approximate representation has the desirable properties of being fixed-size and having simple additive compositionality, thus being especially amenable to treatment with neural networks - both as input and output format, producing efficient conditional estimators. We generalize and reformulate the problem of multi-modal recommendations as conditional, weighted density estimation on manifolds. Our approach allows for trivial inclusion of multiple interaction types, modalities of data as well as interaction strengths for any recommendation setting. Applying EMDE to both top-k and session-based recommendation settings, we establish new state-of-the-art results on multiple open datasets in both uni-modal and multi-modal settings.","stat.ML,cs.IR,cs.LG",2020,human

Our pilot experiments show that PandaGPT can perform complex tasks such as detailed image description generation, writing stories inspired by videos, and answering questions about audios. More interestingly, PandaGPT can take multimodal inputs simultaneously and compose their semantics naturally. For example, PandaGPT can connect how objects look in an image/video and how they sound in an audio. To do so, PandaGPT combines the multimodal encoders from ImageBind and the large language models from Vicuna. Notably, only aligned image-text pairs are required for the training of PandaGPT. Thanks to the strong capability of ImageBind in embedding data from different modalities into the same space, PandaGPT displays emergent, i.e. zero-shot, cross-modal behaviors for data other than image and text (e.g., video, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU). We hope that PandaGPT serves as an initial step toward building AGI that can perceive and understand inputs in different modalities holistically, as we humans do.

Utilizing population synthesis models, we present compelling evidence that the neutron star component forms second. However, the event's low signal-to-noise ratio introduces complexities in identifying the underlying physical mechanisms driving its formation. Augmenting our analysis with insights from numerical relativity, we estimate the final black hole mass and spin to be approximately $5.3 M_\odot$ and $0.53$, respectively. Furthermore, we employ the obtained posterior samples to calculate the ejecta mass and kilonova light curves resulting from r-process nucleosynthesis. We find the ejecta mass to range within $0-0.06 M_{\odot}$, contingent on the neutron star equation of state. The peak brightness of the kilonovae light curves indicates that targeted follow-up observations with a Rubin-like observatory may have detected this emission.","astro-ph.HE,gr-qc",2024,human

We calculate fully non-perturbative, gauge-invariant correlation functions of the electric field as well as the fermion and analyze these correlators in the late-time limit. We compare these results with the perturbative picture, for example by verifying that the one-loop contribution to the fermion two-point function, as predicted from the exact solution, matches the direct computation of the one-loop Feynman diagram.

This guiding philosophy has been carried into the deep learning era, where IRC-safe neural networks have been used for many jet studies. For graph-based neural networks, the most straightforward way to achieve IRC safety is to weight particle inputs by their energies. However, energy-weighting by itself does not guarantee that perturbative calculations of machine-learned observables will enjoy small non-perturbative corrections. In this paper, we demonstrate the sensitivity of IRC-safe networks to non-perturbative effects, by training an energy flow network (EFN) to maximize its sensitivity to hadronization. We then show how to construct Lipschitz Energy Flow Networks (L-EFNs), which are both IRC safe and relatively insensitive to non-perturbative corrections. We demonstrate the performance of L-EFNs on generated samples of quark and gluon jets, and showcase fascinating differences between the learned latent representations of EFNs and L-EFNs.","hep-ph,hep-ex",2023,human

Our results demonstrate that next-token prediction is a promising path towards building general multimodal intelligence beyond language. We open-source key techniques and models to support further research in this direction.",cs.CV,2024,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09847v1,Selective Guidance: Are All the Denoising Steps of Guided Diffusion Important?,"This study examines the impact of optimizing the Stable Diffusion (SD) guided inference pipeline. We propose optimizing certain denoising steps by limiting the noise computation to conditional noise and eliminating unconditional noise computation, thereby reducing the complexity of the target iterations by 50%. Additionally, we demonstrate that later iterations of the SD are less sensitive to optimization, making them ideal candidates for applying the suggested optimization. Our experiments show that optimizing the last 20% of the denoising loop iterations results in an 8.2% reduction in inference time with almost no perceivable changes to the human eye. Furthermore, we found that by extending the optimization to 50% of the last iterations, we can reduce inference time by approximately 20.3%, while still generating visually pleasing images.","cs.LG,cs.CV",2023,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01622v1,Concepts is All You Need: A More Direct Path to AGI,"Little demonstrable progress has been made toward AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) since the term was coined some 20 years ago. In spite of the fantastic breakthroughs in Statistical AI such as AlphaZero, ChatGPT, and Stable Diffusion none of these projects have, or claim to have, a clear path to AGI. In order to expedite the development of AGI it is crucial to understand and identify the core requirements of human-like intelligence as it pertains to AGI. From that one can distill which particular development steps are necessary to achieve AGI, and which are a distraction. Such analysis highlights the need for a Cognitive AI approach rather than the currently favored statistical and generative efforts. More specifically it identifies the central role of concepts in human-like cognition. Here we outline an architecture and development plan, together with some preliminary results, that offers a much more direct path to full Human-Level AI (HLAI)/ AGI.",cs.AI,2023,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14963v1,Vector Search with OpenAI Embeddings: Lucene Is All You Need,"We provide a reproducible, end-to-end demonstration of vector search with OpenAI embeddings using Lucene on the popular MS MARCO passage ranking test collection. The main goal of our work is to challenge the prevailing narrative that a dedicated vector store is necessary to take advantage of recent advances in deep neural networks as applied to search. Quite the contrary, we show that hierarchical navigable small-world network (HNSW) indexes in Lucene are adequate to provide vector search capabilities in a standard bi-encoder architecture. This suggests that, from a simple cost-benefit analysis, there does not appear to be a compelling reason to introduce a dedicated vector store into a modern ""AI stack"" for search, since such applications have already received substantial investments in existing, widely deployed infrastructure.",cs.IR,2023,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07992v2,Eigenvalues of Xin-Laplacian on Complete Riemannian manifolds,"In this paper, we firstly consider Dirichlet eigenvalue problem which is related to Xin-Laplacian on the bounded domain of complete Riemannian manifolds. By establishing the general formulas, combining with some results of Chen and Cheng type, we prove some eigenvalue inequalities. As some applications, we consider the eigenvalues on some Riemannian manifolds admitting with special functions, the translating solitons, minimal submanifolds on the Euclidean spaces, submanifolds on the unit spheres, projective spaces and so on. In particular, for the case of translating solitons, some eigenvalue inequalities are universal. Moreover, we investigate the closed eigenvalue problem for the Xin-Laplacian and generalize the Reilly's result on the first eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. As some remarkable applications, we obtain a very sharp estimate for the upper bound of the second nonzero eigenvalue(without counting multiplicities of eigenvalues) of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the minimal isoparametric hypersurfaces and focal submanifolds in the unit sphere, which leads to a conjecture and is the most fascinating part of this paper.",math.DG,2021,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07556v1,Not All Linearizations Are Equally Data-Hungry in Sequence Labeling Parsing,"Different linearizations have been proposed to cast dependency parsing as sequence labeling and solve the task as: (i) a head selection problem, (ii) finding a representation of the token arcs as bracket strings, or (iii) associating partial transition sequences of a transition-based parser to words. Yet, there is little understanding about how these linearizations behave in low-resource setups. Here, we first study their data efficiency, simulating data-restricted setups from a diverse set of rich-resource treebanks. Second, we test whether such differences manifest in truly low-resource setups. The results show that head selection encodings are more data-efficient and perform better in an ideal (gold) framework, but that such advantage greatly vanishes in favour of bracketing formats when the running setup resembles a real-world low-resource configuration.",cs.CL,2021,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23799v1,On the motion of charged particles in constant electromagnetic field: the parallel case,"This paper is devoted to presenting a rigorous mathematical derivation for the classical phenomenon in Maxwell's theory that a charged particle moves along a straight line in a constant electromagnetic field if the initial velocity is parallel to the constant electromagnetic field. The particle is modeled by scaled solitons to a class of nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations and the nonlinear interaction between the charged particle and the electromagnetic field is governed by the Maxwell-Klein-Gordon system. We show that when the size and amplitude of the particle are sufficiently small, the solution to the coupled nonlinear system exists up to any given time and the energy of the particle concentrates along a straight line. The method relies on the modulation approach for the study of stability for solitons and weighted energy estimates for the Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations.",math.AP,2025,human

Krohn-Rhodes complexity equals the minimal number of groups that are needed. Determining an algorithm to compute complexity has been an open problem for more than 50 years. The main result of this paper proves that it is decidable whether a semigroup has complexity k for any k greater than or equal to 0. This builds on our previous work for complexity 1. In that paper we proved using profinite methods and results on free Burnside semigroups by McCammond and others that the lower bound from a 2012 paper by Henckell, Rhodes and Steinberg is precise for complexity 1. In this paper we define an improved version of the lower bound from the 2012 paper and prove that it is exact for arbitrary complexity.",math.GR,2024,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16180v1,"All Kolmogorov complexity functions are optimal, but are some more optimal?","Kolmogorov (1965) defined the complexity of a string $x$ as the minimal length of a program generating $x$. Obviously this definition depends on the choice of the programming language. Kolmogorov noted that there exist \emph{optimal} programming languages that make the complexity function minimal up to $O(1)$ additive terms, and we should take one of them -- but which one?   Is there a chance to agree on some specific programming language in this definition? Or at least should we add some other requirements to optimality? What can we achieve in this way?   In this paper we discuss different suggestions of this type that appeared since 1965, specifically a stronger requirement of universality (and show that in many cases this does not change the set of complexity functions).",cs.IT,2025,human

The uniqueness of Hermitian-Einstein metrics on a Zariski open subset in a compact Kähler manifold was only figured out by Takuro Mochizuki recently, for this model the second part of this paper gives an affirmative answer to a question proposed by Takuro Mochizuki and it leads to an alternative approach to the unique issue. We also prove stability from solvability of Hermitian-Einstein equation, which together with the classical existence result of Carlos Simpson in particular establish a Kobayashi-Hitchin bijective correspondence. The argument is also effective in more general settings, including basic models of Takuro Mochizuki, as well as non-Kähler and semi-stable contexts.","math.DG,math.AP",2024,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03847v1,All about $H^{\pm\pm}$ in Higgs Triplet Model,"In this piece of work, the nonstandard Higgs boson masses have been constrained by restrictions arising from Higgs diphoton decay width, stability, perturbativity, unitarity and electroweak T-parameter in the framework of the Higgs triplet model. As a matter of fact the loop induced Higgs decays will now obtain additional contributions from singly and doubly charged Higgs bosons. In simulations of pair production of $H^{++}$ it is assumed that the production channel $q\overline{q}\rightarrow γ^{*},Z^{*}\rightarrow H^{++}H^{--}$ is the only mechanism. Whereas there may be other channels of production of doubly charged Higgs bosons as for instance from the decay of singly charged Higgs bosons. The effect of this additional sources of production of the contributing non-standard charged particles to the loop induced Higgs decays has been studied in this paper.",hep-ph,2017,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00942v3,Not All Samples Are Created Equal: Deep Learning with Importance Sampling,"Deep neural network training spends most of the computation on examples that are properly handled, and could be ignored. We propose to mitigate this phenomenon with a principled importance sampling scheme that focuses computation on ""informative"" examples, and reduces the variance of the stochastic gradients during training. Our contribution is twofold: first, we derive a tractable upper bound to the per-sample gradient norm, and second we derive an estimator of the variance reduction achieved with importance sampling, which enables us to switch it on when it will result in an actual speedup. The resulting scheme can be used by changing a few lines of code in a standard SGD procedure, and we demonstrate experimentally, on image classification, CNN fine-tuning, and RNN training, that for a fixed wall-clock time budget, it provides a reduction of the train losses of up to an order of magnitude and a relative improvement of test errors between 5% and 17%.",cs.LG,2018,human
http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0112027v2,Towards an explicit expression of the Seiberg-Witten map at all orders,"The Seiberg-Witten map links noncommutative gauge theories to ordinary gauge theories, and allows to express the noncommutative variables in terms of the commutative ones. Its explicit form can be found order by order in the noncommutative parameter theta and the gauge potential A by the requirement that gauge orbits are mapped on gauge orbits. This of course leaves ambiguities, corresponding to gauge transformations, and there is an infinity of solutions. Is there one better, clearer than the others ? In the abelian case, we were able to find a solution, linked by a gauge transformation to already known formulas, which has the property of admitting a recursive formulation, uncovering some pattern in the map. In the special case of a pure gauge, both abelian and non-abelian, these expressions can be summed up, and the transformation is expressed using the parametrisation in terms of the gauge group.",hep-th,2001,human

In particular, a general equation of state is derived for finite closed systems of interacting particles, where the pressure is expressed directly in terms of the density (or system volume) and temperature-volume dependent reducible cluster integrals. Although its accuracy is now greatly affected by the limited character of the existing data on the reducible cluster integrals and, especially, the absence of any information on their density dependence, a number of simple approximations indicate the qualitative adequacy of this equation in various regimes of a fluid: from gaseous to liquid states (including the transition region).",cond-mat.stat-mech,2018,human
